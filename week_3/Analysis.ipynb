      "i so cannot believe i waited this long to read divergent! thanks to faye at http : / / fayeflamereviews. blogspot. com for telling me that i absolutely had to read this book next! i could not put it down and stayed up into the wee hours of the morning to finish it! what an amazing dystopian ya novel with fabulous characters that will stay with me for a long time. beatrice ( tris ) and four are strong and vulnerable, tender and harsh. there relationship develops beautifully as we discover more and more about their personalities and history. divergent is set in futuristic chicago, which was totally cool since i know all the locations veronica described albeit in her unique, futuristic vision. lake michigan has been reduced to swamp! in divergent, society has been divided into five different factions : candor, abnegation, dauntless, amity, and erudite, each one representing different virtues. the factions should make for a better society, but unfortunately human beings don't always play by the rules. veronica roth created a compelling story about the quest for power and the evil lengths people will go to grab ahold of it. i love the courage and boldness tris and four possess in order to fight against those who will stop at nothing to seize control. if for some reason you haven't read divergent yet, it's an absolute must! oh, i really hate that i have to wait until may, 2012 for book two - insurgent. but the great news is that this is one series that i'm thrilled to see continue.\n",

      "this book surprised me. i'm not a huge paranormal reader, and i enjoyed this book so much more than i thought i would. first of all, it's funny. funny! the world itself is serious, with high stakes, but evie tells her tale with such a refreshing blend of humor and wit, that i chuckled through half the book. and evie. can we talk about how bleeping awesome evie is? i absolutely loved that she is more of a girly - girl but still kicks butt. i've read so many tough - girl heroines lately ( katniss, tris, etc ), and while i love those ladies just as much, i thoroughly enjoyed how evie stood apart from them. she loves fashion, digs pink, swoons over guys, and still has a level head on her shoulder. she is girly and she embraces that and rocks it the entire way through the book. on top of it all, those tough girls i mentioned above? evie still channels half of their personalities, too! she is brave. she is confident. she challenges the status quo and asks questions. she is who she is and she never apologizes for that. go, evie! you rock. there's also an adorable romance that is full of flirty glances and first touches. and a brooding faerie who was glorious shades of gray. i loved him so much i can barely wait to get my hands on the sequel. and let's not forget evie's taser, pink no less. with rhinestones. yes, rhinestones. you know you want one. originally reviewed here\n",

      "i wanted - badly - to read if i lie from the very moment i first glimpsed the cover and read the synopsis. i sent in an arc request, and to my delight, one arrived for me. i have a huge soft spot for ya contemporary novels, and something about this one struck a nerve with me. i began quinn's story with high hopes, and by the time i read the final page, i had shed tears of both happiness and sorrow for quinn. she's braver than anyone in her small town knows, and i felt like i walked every step of her journey with her. debut author corrine jackson has created a fantastic story that blurs the lines between the truth and a lie. along the way, quinn is forced to question her loyalty to her boyfriend, carey, who despite only being in if i lie for a short time, was a hugely vivid presence, as jackson illustrated his relationship with quinn through flashbacks that filled in the missing pieces. i felt like i knew and loved carey, too. all of the characters - major or minor - felt so real, like jackson had breathed so much life into them. i identified most with quinn, whether it was when she faced her accusers at school, or tried to get her distant father to notice her. my heart ached for her as more of her past was revealed, and i wanted so ardently for quinn to find a happy ending. if i lie was, at times, a difficult book to read. quinn's bullying and how her classmates ostracized her felt achingly real. there were so many times that i wished just one of her \" friends \" would stand up for her, or that blake ( carey's best friend ) would support her. i cried several times for her, but in the end, i was so very proud of sophie quinn for growing as a person, for becoming stronger. i love a novel with character growth, and that was definitely there in if i lie. what really stood out to me in if i lie were the relationships between the characters. corrine jackson does an amazing job of humanizing these characters, and showing what they mean to quinn through their interactions. i sobbed as i watched quinn and her father try to rebuild their relationship, and i grinned and teared up in the scenes with quinn and george - a war vet who became like a father to her. and of course, the interaction between quinn and carey and quinn and blake absolutely tore at my heart. i loved the\n",

      "after having waited for so long to find out what happens next, finding out there was finally going to be another story had me beyond excited. it's been so long, and knowing that this wasn't particularly about harry but rather his child i was apprehensive. i tried to go into this with the bar slightly lowered - surely a script couldn't match the series, it just wouldn't be the same, right? fortunately, i am happy to say it certainly did match the series! though it was a little strange to be reading harry potter as a script rather than a novel everything was still there, and the characters were just as i imagined them. i could picture it all in my mind as if it hadn't been years since the last instalment. that being said, it was fast paced which made me wish this were a novel so we just got more details and more of the'solving the mystery'part of the harry potter series more - just more. these changes were to be expected as the whole story had to fit into the length of a stage show but oh, how i am craving more, new harry potter now. mostly though, this was great. i loved every minute of it, and found myself hanging in suspense on more than one occasion. not to mention, it revisits one of my favourite books in the series which is in itself, awesome. there's enough that happens here to extend the harry potter series which definitely excites me and should any harry potter fan ( ( view spoiler ) [ voldemort has a daughter to bellatrix - who was technically probably in the malfoy manor when harry, ron and hermione were - what?!?! ( hide spoiler ) ] ). this deserves a re - read and a spot on the favourites shelf. even after this latest story, even after all these years, always.\n",

      "focus on me is not for the faint of heart, let me tell you. a little something about myself? i'm usually have the emotional capacity of a stone when it comes to reading and i bawled while reading about colin and riley. seriously, big, fat ugly tears. i think my husband looked at me like i was crazy, but that's okay. focus on me touched me in a way that few books do and i loved every minute of it. colin and riley are such wonderful characters. they are everything i would want from this story and maybe even more than i thought i'd get. i found myself falling for them, their journey and everything because of megan's wonderful writing. she created such a vibrant world for these two that it felt like you were in that beat up jeep and hotel rooms with them. colin is very relatable in the fact that he's on his way home from dropping out of college. he's not terribly upset that it didn't work out, but he is upset that it's just another failure in his life of failures. he's more than content to go home and work in the family restaurant but feels like he should have done something more with his life. when he meets catwalk he sees someone who he is instantly drawn to. as riley joins him on his drive home the two become close and colin begins to see there's much more to riley than he lets on. riley is a successful model but gave it up at the peak of his popularity. he needs something more out of life. hell, he just needs something, to feel something. his life has always been one dark patch after another and it has taken its toll. when he meets colin he finds that he can try and let go and start feeling. but it doesn't work and in the end, colin isn't always going to be enough. in focus on me megan erickson touches on mental health and how it effects not only that person but the people around them. i don't want to get too much into it because it'll become a slippery slope into spoilers, but needless to say, megan wrote it with grace and dignity and that's something i cannot be more thankful of. mental health awareness is something i'm very passionate about and this book will go a long way in spreading that awareness. thank you megan. if you read the previous novel, trust the focus, and you should if you haven't, you'll be\n",

      "originally read : july 30, 2011 first re - read : january 8, 2017 daughter of smoke and bone is one of the most anticipated novels of september, and maybe even 2011. it's a thrilling start to a series, and so refreshing to read because of its unique setting ( prague! ), its even more unique main character ( karou! ), and even the way it's written makes this book not seem like another star - crossed love between an an angel and a demon. karou is such an interesting character and so is her background. just reading about her and her life, then how she finds out who she is, is so interesting. the first line shows karou's personality, in my opinion : walking to school over the snow - muffled cobbles, karou had no sinister premoitions about the day. love. doesn't that make you want to read more?! this book is very well paced - - i wasn't bored at all while reading it, but the second half really picks up, especially when it could be viewed as info dropping when karou learns who she is. the last 150 pages or so fly right on by, and i wanted to savor them, to breathe in taylor's way with words, but i also wanted to know more - - to finally know who karou really is and who mysterious akiva is. this book. swoon. so gorgeous, the outside and inside are. so unique and refreshing and yum. i want to gobble it back up again. my only problem was the hype surrounding it. everybody was saying how wonderful this book was and how it'd make you forget everything and everyone, but it took me awhile to get to the point of forgetting everybody and everything. when i got page 300, that's when i sat down and didn't get up until i flipped the last page. do i recommend? hell yes i do. even those who don't like fantasy i'm recommending this book to. so, so good! read it. : ) this review is also posted ongypsy book reviews.\n",

      "i caught myself thinking about this book days after closing the cover. i had only one fault with this novel, one small tiny instance near the end where i thought lola acted wise beyond her years, but everything else is pure gold. lola is spunky and inventive and believes in costume over fashion. her dads are fantastic, supportive parents. the dog is named heavens to betsy ( come on, gold! ). anna and etienne make cameo appearances ( several times over ) and some wonderfully rich family dynamics come into play when lola's birth mother re - enters the story. and then of course, there's the boy next store. cricket bell. somehow, this book managed to make me seventeen again, pining over this boy, dissecting everything he said, decoding every glance or shoulder shrug. and while i swooned over etienne while reading anna and the french kiss, i loved cricket more. some of this might have to do with his appearance, which reminds me of the engineer ( ok, so maybe i'm bias ). cricket is a tall, gangly tinker - er, making odd contraptions and inventions all while wearing pants that never fall quite as long as they should. he is also so darn sweet it will break your heart. every time cricket or lola were on the page together i sat there smirking and thinking, kiss! kiss! how does perkins do this to me? this book had all the sweet, adorable, love - budding sexual tension that existed in anna, but something about this book felt more real to me. perhaps it was because they were in the states, and parents were present, and i can relate more easily to the streets of san fran than the eiffel tower. either way, this book is magical. how stephanie perkins makes me grin like an idiot while reading about fictional characters, i have no idea. i spent a solid five days after reading this book replaying the ending in my head and smiling to myself. i am a permanent fan from here on out. stephanie, keep writing these, please? i will read every last one. originally reviewed here\n",

      "2016 was decent as far as reading went. there was a stinker here and there, some things i couldn't finish, but overall a satisfying year. in order of date read, here are some of the highlights. first, in fiction : a brief history of seven killings ( and, though i read it in dec 2015, it deserves mention as well - the book of night women ) : i don't usually pick up a book because it gets an award but i read a review of marlon james'a brief history and was interested enough to pick it up. as it turned out, i was # 45 or something along those lines in my library's hold queue and first read the book of night women. i was very impressed by that volume and equally so by the second. one of my goals in 2017 is to read john crow's devil. the life of sir aglovale de galis : clemence housman's life of this eldest son of king pellinore is one of the best arthurian romances i've read. ever. the ladies of grace adieu : i have never been able to \" get into \" susanna clark's jonathan strange & mr. norrell but i found her short stories very enjoyable. she's able to capture the fairy ambience well, similar to sylvia townsend warner's kingdoms of elfin. silver on the road : a serendipitous find at the library. laura anne gilman writes about an alternate american west ruled by the devil. i eagerly anticipate the sequel due out in 2017. i'd also recommend her trilogy the vineart war. blackdog : another serendipitous find. a standalone fantasy novel ( which alone would make it worthy of inclusion on this list, if only for the novelty ) by k. v. johansen. the great ordeal : this is the penultimate book in r. scott bakker's second trilogy set in the world of earwa, and holy * * * *, it was amazing. the final volume, the unholy consult, cannot come out too soon. babayaga : this is a follow up - though not a sequel - to toby barlow's epic werewolf poem sharp teeth. and it was just as good, if not better ( though don't expect a retelling of the russian fairy tale ). the etched city : i lucked on to this book by k. j. bishop because a friend of mine was cleaning out\n",

      "07 / 01 / 14 im so happy i reread this i can't remember the last time i felt so emotionally attached to characters :') all of my reviews are spoiler free ( unless stated otherwise ) so you can go ahead and read my review! review : characters : throughout most of the book, we only hear from the two main characters as they're stranded on an island, but this in no way made this boring. these characters were so well fleshed out i felt like they were real people. the other characters that we see in the other parts of the book all felt so real as well and they all had their own characteristics that made them them, if that makes sense. they're all so wonderfully written, that's all i can say! plot : i love survival stories and this is definitely my favourite as of this point in my life. it follows anna, a 30 year old teacher and t. j., a 16 year old boy in remission. as a summer job, t. j.'s parents have offered anna a heck of a lot of money and a place to stay at their holiday house in the maldives if she tutors t. j. throughout the holidays so he can catch up on all that he's missed while he was sick. problem is, they're on a very small plane when the pilot has a sudden heart attack and they end up on a deserted island. i love this plot line. it's perfection and the way it was executed was just perfect. writing : absolutely brilliant. i could not put it down! it was written so beautifully and in a way that had me so attached to the characters. perfect. romance / feels : so good. obviously it's a bit of a forbidden romance as there's a huge age gap, but something's bound to happen if they're by themselves on an island for a long amount of time ( this isn't a spoiler, it's in the blurb ). i cried when i first read this book. i had so many feels. ending : so perfect. i couldn't ask for a better fleshed out ending. i won't say anymore because spoilers, ya know? overall enjoyment : one of my favourite books of all time that i still think about months after i've read it. i enjoyed every single sentence of this book! rereadability : i intend to reread this book so much throughout my life! i\n",

      "i opened this arc yesterday to glance at it ( i have other books going ) and absolutely fell into it. and a debut? what a stunning book! i was going to avoid it, as i am tired of teenage gladiatorial books with sloppy worldbuilding that only exists to throw the teens into a pit to fight themselves bloody ( between swooning and angsting over their lurve triangle ) but i stumbled on a reference to there being only one white character in this book, and i had to read it. i am so glad i did. make no mistake, the tension - line is at maximum overdrive, because the competition is there, hoo boy is it there. but reintgen has put together a fascinating world that promises all kinds of layers behind the mega corporation babel, who funds this trip to a new planet called eden, where a mysterious substance called nyxia is being mined. but it's being controlled by indigenous people who slaughtered the adults and protected the children in the initial exploration party. so many interesting questions lie outside, to be answered in subsequent volumes, meanwhile this one concerns emmet, a black kid from detroit, trying to find his place among the other nine teens on their ship : while they travel to eden, the ten embark on a super intense training regimen that is meant to eliminate two from the ten. what i found exceptionally good was how emmet struggles not only to be the best, but to define what that best is. he's all the conflicts of human nature wrapped up in one complex kid : his parents, he knows, define the best as being a good man, not merely a physically strong or lethal one. and it is not clear that the adults training and watching over these kids want the same thing. reintgen does a terrific job with the female characters. they are complex, fascinating, frightening, wonderful. all the characters are distinct, and watching how they develop is as absorbing as the steadily heightening threats of the training. the writing is so much better than that in the usual run of ya gladiatorial novels - - taut, vivid, intelligent, insightful, heartbreaking as well as exhilarating, and only * one spelling mistake * ( free reign instead of free rein ) and no grammar oopses. rare! meanwhile there's the nyxia itself. what is that stuff? i look forward to finding out ; meantime this is one of my best reads of the year so far. copy provided by netgalley\n",

      "santa sent me an arc of this, and it was everything i wanted it to be and more. in full disclosure, i am good friends and critique partners with susan, but i promise you my love for this story is genuine. i'd read the first two thirds of this book in word doc form, and loved it. i read the ending in bound arc form and cried happy, bittersweet tears. there is so much to love about this book. pyramids! necromancy! mummies and magic and flying airships! susan brought 1876 philadelphia and paris to life effortless in the previous installments, and she succeeds again in s & ea with egypt. the scenery is rich and the plot thrilling ( think indiana jones meets the mummy ). and the ending! this is one of my favorite trilogy conclusions. everyone is changed. everyone has grown, especially eleanor, and no one gets there without sacrifice. the final chapter was as beautiful and moving and as close to perfect as an author can get. miss fitt will always hold a dear place in my heart. note : this review is based on an arc. originally reviewed here.\n",

      "* * spoiler alert * * all our characters are back together at the beginning of this book, in fal dara, resting and recuperating after the end of the eye of the world. there is a lot for them to deal with, more for some than others, but they all have \" issues \" of their own now. but almost straight away the group is split up. egwene and nyneave are off to tar valon while the rest head in pursuit of darkfriends and trollocs, and even then rand and loial get separated from the others. apart from moiraine and lan, they are off stage for most of this book, as moiraine is off researching. and a lot of the first half of the book is establishing what's going on. there is a fair amount of characters travelling here and then there and then over yonder. and there is a lot of denial going on. rand refuses to entertain the possibility that he may be the dragon reborn. perrin doesn't want to talk to the wolves, and mat, well, mat doesn't have much to do but serve as impetus to get the dagger back. not til the end of the book. as for egwene and nyneave, well they show us what tar valon is like as they head off to learn what it is that an aes sedai actually is. and boy are they in for a surprise. but they do meet up with min again, and with elayne, and learn that rand has had a impact on the world already, even if it is only to prompt people to think about changing their lives. but the second half of this book really kicks off the action. the final third in particular is brilliant. i love the build - up to the battle at the end, it really gets the heart pumping. and we meet the seanchan, who are awesome and evil and icky all at the same time, i mean the damane, that's just horrible. there is a lot going on in this book. and only on rereading it do you realise just how much foreshadowing and hinting at future events was going on. and the forsaken begin to come on stage. just hints and occasional appearances, nothing like in later books, but they are there, plotting and meddling. lanfear in particular. i always liked her. she was evil, sure, but cool. and min gets more to do\n",

      "until we see mainstream gay romances with happy endings, i won't read this book or watch the film. this is the stereotypical classic story of men who can't admit they're gay and when they try to be happy, it ends in tragedy. all movies with gay main characters ended tragically until very very recently. it's a very specific stereotype that says once again that gay people can never really be happy. they have to be closeted and ashamed and then die. it makes me furious that hollywood chose this as it's vehicle to bring a gay romance to the big screen. there are beautiful stories out there about gay men falling in love and dealing with these same issues that don't end in tragedy. that don't have men terrified of who they are and living a lie that is cruel to themselves and their families. by always portraying gay leads as tragic, they aren't just saying that being in a gay relationship will end in tragedy, they're saying being gay will end in tragedy. it's time for the mainstream to see that being gay is okay even for leading men. you don't have to die or lose the love of your life just because you're gay. you can actually be happy.\n",

      "copy provided by the publisher. stephanie burgis, well - loved as an author for ya and middle - grade fantasy, hits the ground running with her first adult fantasy in this fast - moving, sometimes wistful and romantic, sometimes sinister opera of a novel, masks and shadows, which should appeal to readers who enjoy palace intrigue with a dash of fantastical horrorific elements. charlotte, a young widowed baroness, travels to the new esterhazy estate built by the extravagant prince nicolaus, where haydn works as kapellmeister. obedient, good - hearted and sheltered, she meets her first castrato in carlo morelli, famous throughout europe. at first she is aghast, but after playing accompaniment to his singing, she undergoes a significant change of heart. charlotte's sister is the current mistress to the prince, thus charlotte's invitation among an exclusive company that is made up of titled people, many of whom have ulterior motives of various kinds. charlotte's maid anna is a natural - born singer, and when discovered by the delighted haydn, we are also introduced to the musicians and actors and singers as haydn prepares a new opera for staging. ( anna's training as a singer is my favorite bit in the story ; talented as she is, she doesn't get to waltz in and take over to universal acclaim. in fact, her whole arc was my favorite of the many threads. ) near the end, empress maria theresa in company with her son joseph ( with whom she co - ruled the last ten years of her life ) arrives for a surprise visit... in time for a sinister plot to reach fruition. danger and dastardly deeds abound. the novel is set in 1779, and features a number of once - living people, but ( like an opera ) finesses a few actual details in order to build a better story. also like an opera, it's plotted with dramatic motivations and plenty of sneaking around between scenes of high life, leading to a horrific climax that would be terrific to stage. the musical theme that runs through it enhances the operatic effect - - at some points i was hearing don giovanni in the back of my mind. ( most appropriately! burgis lets them be pen friends a few years before they actually met. ) lavish descriptions of the famous palace, plenty of characters high and low, and a running thread of intrigue and evil plotting make a thoroughly fun romp of a book.\n",

      "student review by dami ( 12th grade ) grade range : 10 - 12 genre : fantasy / sci - fi / steampunk literary merit : excellent characterization : excellent recommendation : highly recommended review : mare barrow lives in a world where blood means everything, a land that is constantly at war because of a lack of resources not enough to keep two kingdoms healthy. there are those with silver and others with red blood. the reds are sent to war once they turn 18, unless they get have found work, while the silver live in lavish palaces made of glass. but the colour of their blood is not the only difference between them, the silvers have powers that make them stronger and better than the bloods. mare discovers she has something special she shouldn't have, and with this comes her discovery of the secrets of the royal family, and the rebellion of the scarlet guard. i thought this novel was interesting in the way that it has a science fiction as well as a fantasy aspect, mixing magic with technology and nature to create an almost completely different genre. the characterization was great in the way that the author was able to give everyone a back story, and she also didn't have any qualms about killing off characters that the readers and main characters have strong connections with. the plot interested me because the main character didn't always win simply because she was the main character, and there were battles that she couldn't win. recommendation : it was an amazing book that i would recommend to anyone.\n",

      "flynn beckham marches to his own beat. he has a passion for music, but doesn't care about being a rockstar. the love and adoration of his 5 year old niece is much more important. we realized flynn was more than just your average bear when we met him in throb. he recognized true love, and stepped aside to let two souls connect. this time, he's not stepping aside. he's found his other half, and he's holding on tight with both hands. his connection with lucky is more than anything he's ever experience. he knows this is it for him. lucky thought she was the luckiest girl when she landed her dream guy, dylan ryder. after meeting, flynn, maybe it isn't the kind of luck she wants. after spending time with him, is what she feels really love? after losing her dad, she's a bit gun shy when it comes to anything musical and would rather hide in her safe cocoon. changes are scary, and lucky isn't quite sure what to do. it looks like life isn't going to wait for lucky to take the safe and easy route. there is no possible way you can't love flynn. there are times you might want to smack lucky for not figuring out what she wants. regardless, they are magical together. i get that making big decisions are scary, but you only get one shot at this life. if you really want something out of life - love, a career, whatnot - you can't be afraid to go for it, or you'll miss out on the opportunity. regret is the most bitter of pills. vi keeland did a bang up job with this book. the writing and story flowed so well i devoured this book in less than 24 hours. i couldn't stop cheering for the sweetness that is flynn. there were some other great characters in the book i'd like to get to know better ; i sure hope we can get to know nolan a little better. he's a riot and i smell a story in his background. 5 / 5 stars and i'm officially adding flynn the bbf lineup!\n",

      "initial reaction : i laughed. i cried. i gave up on sleep to devour this story and loved it. my heart is so happy that i was able to revisit the wizarding world and check in on many of my beloved favorite literary characters. after the initial shock of reading this story so quickly faded and i was able to think past the shock of new harry potter content, i became conflicted. let me explain... right from the start, all of the hype for this script book had me skeptical. i was worried about the intentions behind it and didn't want anything to tarnish the memory of the harry potter series that i hold so dear. the cursed child is not the eighth harry potter book. it will not sit on my shelf with those 7 books as if it's a continuation of that series. those books hold a very special spot in my heart so of course i was nervous as to what this new content could turn out to be. i went into the cursed child without high expectations because i didn't want to set myself up for disappointment. having that mindset helped me to not put pressure on the story to be perfect and allowed me to enjoy and appreciate it for what it was. i was pleasantly surprised by how much i liked it and extremely happy to gain two new characters in the harry potter universe that i now adore ; albus and scorpius. particularly scorpius! however, this story has flaws. the biggest of which is the twisting of established magical rules within the harry potter universe. it felt like much of the plot was thrown together in a haphazard way just for the sake of convenience for telling the story they wanted to tell. if you don't read too much into details and don't question the rules or laws of magic this may not bother you. but the more i think about it, the more bothered i become. i could forever rant about this but i won't get into it much more because of spoilers. my other issues with the cursed child are more minor. the pacing was difficult at times but i can piece things together better in my mind if i envision this work as the play it is intended to be. i hope one day i am lucky enough to see it so i can witness this story in its full glory. the only other issue i have that is worth noting would be the lack of time with the characters in this story and also the hole i felt in my heart by the characters missing from\n",

      "when reason breaks is a deeply moving story that addresses the issues of depression and suicide. teacher ms. diaz introduces her students to emily dickinson, and her poetry has a tremendous influence on the characters in this novel. emotionally charged issues of true friendship, dating, sex, and betrayal combined with overpowering parents for one character and a parent grieving from her divorce for another, impact this story. beautifully written, people will feel elizabeth's anger and emily's struggle with her identity and the emotions that come with it, the confusion that comes with sadness and loss, developing relationships and those relationships that break. i love the complexity cindy rodriguez brings to all her characters. i definitely recommend this novel for anyone who likes a serious contemporary ya. i'm certain the characters will remain with readers long after they finish. bravo, ms. rodriguez for shining a new light on tough issues. in addition, the dickinson references and ms. rodriguez's explanation of those references will introduce dickinson to young adults - - some for the first time. they'll learn more about her life and poetry, which i am certain will get some to explore dickinson's work further! thank you to bloomsbury for providing the arc.\n",

      "i read gillian flynn's debut, sharp objects, several years ago and instantly fell in love with her prose ( lush but not overwritten ) and the dark, twisted nature of her story - telling. i've been a fan for awhile and when i started seeing fabulous reviews of gone girl, i knew i was bound to love it. and i did. nick and amy dunne are a happy, married couple of five years - at least on the surface. but on the day of their fifth anniversary, amy goes missing. all signs point to a kidnapping / murder, with nick as a very probable suspect. told in alternating povs, ( nick in the present, amy via diary entries ), the true nature of their rocky marriage is revealed, as well as the instability of their character. this is one of those novels that has to be read to be appreciated, not to mention that saying too much will ruin the very things that make the story fabulous. i will say only that i was sucked in from the very first line and that flynn is a master of suspense and characterization. nick and amy feel so real they could be your neighbors - the same is true for the secondary characters as well. i saw a few twists coming, but it didn't diminish how much i enjoyed the book. this is a twisted, thrilling, and entirely entertaining read. and the ending! perhaps the best final lines of a novel i have read in a long time. chills. chills, everywhere. highly recommend. originally posted here.\n",

      "this is my second year writing one of these and it has seen me in an interesting place personally. book - wise, as well, i have seen my reading - choices change a bit. last year, my top read was the souls of black folk ( everyman's library. this year it was tom king's the vision : little worse than a man, little better than a beast. as i talked about in my review of volume 2, i felt that the existential horror that the vision family experiences and manifests into real horror reflected some of themes of the souls of black folk and the plays of eugene o'neill. i am just so amazed at what king and the artists were able to do. from this point on i will discuss the few regular books i read and then the comics i read. i did not read as many books as i wanted, but i did do something that i rarely do : read a new book. that book was homegoing by yaa gyasi. this ambitious, first novel was eagerly anticipated by me and an amazing and slightly frustrating first entry into what i hope is a long, maturing career. i read some very good poetry this year. the black poets, an anthology book i happened on by chance in a thrift store, may be the best poem anthology book i have ever read. i also finally finished the essential rumi after 6 years and it was worth the slow read. i did a lot better with play than novels and poetry volumes. i read my second and third chekhov plays this year. uncle vanya and three sisters were both good plays but, to my great surprise, i preferred \" vanya \" more. the emotional depth and overwhelming sense of human beauty in sorrow touched my heart and hit close to \" home \" for me this year. i also read my first two plays by henrik ibsen. hedda gabler sees the norwegian bourgeois become ensnared in a kierkegaardian karmic cycle. it is an amazingly powerful and unsentimental play. the master builder was equally enjoyable and i may have liked the individual characters more than with hedda gabler. i can't wait to read an enemy of the people. i read three shakespeare plays for the first time, this year. henry vi, part 3 was the third play by shakespeare and the point where he finally finds and connects the traits that makes his plays iconic. as you like it was an interesting look at what happens when old will phones it in and the\n",

      "i cannot do this. i will not do this. this book is like when a loved one lays dying in a hospital bed, sickly, washed - out, and hooked up to all sorts of machines. more specifically, this book is like when that loved one asks you not to remember them that way, but rather as the way they were when they lived. the monstrumologist series has been such an incredible ride, full of growth and beauty and pain and horror. i want to remember it as being as fantastic as i know it is, not the way the final descent is shaping up to make it. it takes two of the most complex, interesting characters i've ever had the pleasure to read of and shoots them into a very bleak future - it seems that none of their qualities that i've come to know and love have survived. will henry is a brutish, melodramatic teen ; warthrop is bitter and on the brink of death.

      "i'm obsessed february! i have to wait until february for the third book to be released! i can't believe i have to wait that long! february! okay, i might have gone a tinsy bit character crazy. i loved them in the first book, and now i'm thoroughly character obsessed. needless to say, the night i finished this i got little to no sleep. i kept playing over what could possibly happen in book 3. i should have stopped with promise of blood. i should've waited to start the second one. i just didn't think i'd fall any further in love with the characters. but i did. it only took me the first few chapters to be addicted to taniel. he was already the front runner. half way, i was just as crazy about tamas. i can't get enough of the father and son duo. we get to hear about tamas's past just a bit and see him have an emotional breakdown. taniel also shines with some new talent. great character development for both! surprisingly, i was still even enjoying adamat's story. i didn't skim anywhere. it was perfectly balanced. and the action? oh heck yeah! still as amazing! ( view spoiler ) [ spoiler : taniel beats through the chest of a warden, rips out its rib, and stabs the warden in the eye with its own rib!!!!! how friggin awesome is that?!?! end spoiler ( hide spoiler ) ] the magic is still incredibly fun to read, and we're even getting some new types introduced. it wasn't necessarily needed, but it definitely didn't take away from my enjoyment in the least. the only negative i can scrape together is that the storyline itself moves a tad bit slower than the first book. only on reflection, with hours of trying to think of negatives, did i come up with that one. i'm just too involved with the characters and thoroughly engaged in the story and writing to think of it as a truly negative point. though the beginning was slower, much like the first book, it picked up quickly and then never stopped. i can honestly say that i love the actual story as much as the first one, but overall, because of some of the scenes with the characters, i was just a bit more in love with this book. so to end my ramblings, i cannot recommend this series enough.\n",

      "while i'm beyond bummed that my spines don't match on my bookshelf - why razorbill! why?! - i thoroughly enjoyed the final installment of beth revis'across the universe trilogy. as elder and amy take the shuttle from godspeed to centauri - earth and wake the frozens, they find their paradise is much more like the world orion warned them of. the planet indeed has \" monsters \" - carnivorous pterodactyl - like creatures - and perhaps even more. as members of their colony begin to be killed off, amy and elder race to discover who ( or what ) is killing their people. extra tension is present by way of amy's father, who is leading the military, and elder, who is trying to remain a leader figure to his own people. narrated again in alternating perspectives from amy and elder, this is an addictive, fast read. details that popped up in book one resurface in soe, tying everything together in a thoroughly satisfying manner. no one is safe - no one - and the ending itself, like book one, is filled with hope. things are not perfect, but there is a future for those left standing, should they chose to work together. i don't want to say much more because otherwise i risk spoiling a few of the fantastic twists, but if you enjoyed the first two books in the series, i don't think you'll be disappointed with this conclusion originally posted here.\n",

      "captive by a. d. robertson is an adult spin - off of andrea cremer's nightshade series. y'all, let me say that again, captive is an adult spin - off. like adult, adult. captive starts with a bang, the prologue and first few chapters are stellar and i mean stellar. the world - building and character development are astounding. having not read the nightshade series i was afraid i would be lost, the world seems very detailed and complicated. thankfully that did not happen, robertson does a great job getting everyone clear on her fantastic world. however as much as i loved the world and characters, once sarah was held captive, the world stood still so sarah and tristan could fall in love. yes, i am totally aware that this is a romance book and that's how romance books typically go. i was just hoping for more dynamic interactions with other characters and other plot lines, and not so sarah and tristan focused. hey, a girl can dream, right? sarah is the star of this book, she is tough, smart, knows what she wants and is adaptable ( to a point ). she took being prisoner with grace, and totally was the mastermind behind her escape. enter tristan. he has been stuck on the island for years, and while he may have dreamt of escaping he never actually put it into motion. he seemed to let life happen to him instead of making his life his own. so for me, he fizzled. however, together these two lit up the pages. can you say h o t? really h o t? if you are a fan of andre cremer, or just a fan of paranormal romance this is a must read for you!!\n",

      "* deep sigh * i have to be super honest : i really, really loved this book. i loved its portrayal of family ( the family in this book may be my favourite of all time? ), loved its portrayal of friendship, loved its exploration of grief and love, and salvador's quiet struggles. the writing was also beautiful ; the narrator of the audiobook did such a beautiful job that i cried listening to this story. ( view spoiler ) [ more so, this book resonated with me on a deeper level, especially regarding its exploration of grief and loss. it's been almost 15 years since my grandfather passed away, and i think i never got over it properly - - i think this book helped me a little bit. ( hide spoiler ) ] but. this book has problematic elements that i have to address. - numerous offensive phrases - the way the sexual assault was handled ( could have been much better ) what is most frustrating is that, given the above, in the grand scheme of the book those problematic elements did not have to be in the book. they weren't integral to the overarching storyline nor the character's development. the story would not have suffered without them. i've left the book unrated for now. i may give it a rating when i come to review it.\n",

      "originally posted on slow reader's blog have you ever been inundated by a book, seemingly seeing images of it wherever you turn, stalked by ads, nudged by reviews? i read dark matter somewhat out of frustration, because i kept seeing that distinct red and black cover, even though it's not typically a book that would even be in my stratosphere. i don't read science fiction, and i don't read thrillers. but, thanks to amazon's creepy ass algorithm, goodreads, and barnes & noble for their clever shelving, i succumbed and decided to read this book. call it fate, or simply math and science... whatever. this book called to me and i'm thrilled! that i read it. if i had to describe this book in a word, i would say gripping. and it never let go. dark matter was a surprisingly addicting and emotional read. well, maybe not completely surprising since i love watching action thrillers, but i never read them. although, i might have to begin reading more, since i found dark matter to be completely compelling and consuming. it was an adrenaline rush i won't soon forget. but, the part that i loved the most about crouch's gripping fiction, was the romance. yes, this book has romance ; in fact, i found it to be a central theme. everything the protagonist does is for his loves, his wife and his child. dark matter is about man, a husband, a father, a physicist, who one night leaves his family to get ice - cream only to end up kidnapped, drugged, and awoken in a world where everything is different. i won't say anything more regarding the plot, because i think the synopsis gives you exactly what you need, and because i can't even begin to explain what i just read. dark matter is mind - boggling and you really need to read it to understand it. i loved this book. i loved this book because of the characters and the message. blake crouch made me fall in love with content that i'm unfamiliar with, because of the situations and the story he created. this book has so much heart, and the themes of life and choices, regret, the question of what if, the uncertainty of identity all make for a novel that readers, even ones that aren't sci - fi enthusiasts can enjoy, if they just give it a chance. sure, it's about quantum physics, and before reading\n",

      "for 2016 my goal was to read 110 books, with the majority of them belonging to the children's lit genre. i thought it would be easy because children's books are short, and readily available at the library. the problem was that the types of children's books that were readily available ( and inexpensive / free ) were generally not the kind that would hold my interest. i'm sure i read many more books than i even bothered to rate on goodreads, but many of these short reads just didn't resonate with me enough to care to immortalize them here. its not that they weren't good quality books, but their writing styles were geared towards a certain developmental level and i was just not good seeing them with the eyes of a child. i think my reading experiences this year would have been a lot more fulfilling and meaningful if i had been able to read to a child. ( coincidentally, i've been able to do much more of that in 2017 than i did in 2016 ) there were, however, some children's stories that i enjoyed immensely despite this handicap. the complete tales of winnie - the - pooh seriously, i didn't even like the cartoons very much growing up but this book made me cry at the end. it's basically about this kid and his dad making up adventures with the kid's dolls. to me it reinforces how significant this kind of pretend play is for kids in their formative years. it's always been something i believed strongly in, but to get to the end and realize how intentional all of that was really got to me. reminiscing on this work now, it is especially poignant because now i've had the experience of engaging in this type of pretend play with my nephew. i also immensely enjoyed the works of roald dahl which is interesting, because i don't think i would have enjoyed most of his work very much as a kid, but it's so friggin hilarious now! i read these books alone, but i did get to read some of them at the same time as my other nephew and niece, which was great fun! because they loved the books too, and we got to talk about them, and we got to go see the bfg movie together! i read much of rudyard kipling's work ( for children ), and i also enjoyed most of it. my favorite story was rikki - tikki - tavi it was very exciting! another delightful surprise was\n",

      "rhanye's review posted on guilty pleasures book reviews 4. 5 stars cash and lilly's story is an explosive tale of two people who ultimately get a rare second chance. at times it is sad, at times it's scorching hot, and at times drenched with anger and hate. however, from cover to cover it is filled with passion, emotion, forgiveness and love that can only be experienced when you find your boom! we learn a little bit about cash and lilly's relationship in book two, until trevor. it left off with heartbreak and shattered dreams for this couple. there was no question this book was going to be filled with drama and no question we were going to travel down a very bumpy road as these two overcome the past and claim their happiness. i have read many books with a mean, conniving, meddling ex who just can't let go, but i must say ms. reynolds created a whole new category for evil bitch when she created jules. i'm sure it's not healthy to hate a pretend person to the depths that i hate her. luckily the hatred was chased with a beautiful love story tangled through the crazy to help pull you through. her schemes to try and destroy lilly and cash were gut wrenching. lilly brings a whole new definition to the word strong. her relationship with cash was so new and exciting and consumed with love for the short time they had together. she was shattered when he walked away leaving her alone.... and pregnant. cash is truly such a good guy it's hard to hate on him. even lilly tells him she wants to hate him, but can't. he was manipulated by jules and had no choice but to give up lilly to protect his child with jules. he is an amazing dad, but he is just as destroyed on the inside about losing his one and only love. once these two find their way back to each other they are tested time and time again by jules antics. she sets out to destroy lilly. i don't want to get too far into the nasty because i think it's a better effect to actually read about it, but honestly lilly and cash prove to be an unshaken force. they are so amazing together. they let jules tear them apart for four years and they are not about to let that happen again. it's a true battle where in the end the good guys win. i have said many times that i love the addition of children in my books. i\n",

      "okay, marie. i'm ready. where's my book? definitely my favorite cover of the trilogy. can't wait for this one!! edit 5 / 7 / 2016 : i've made a grave mistake. after waiting a year for this book to be released, then another month because my library is silly and i wanted to pause on purschasing it until the paperback came out... i made the error of reading this book within 24 hours of setting down a court of mist and fury. i was anxiously awaiting the winner's kiss. the first two drew me in so well ; i was hooked. one of my favorite series. but maas blew my mind and drained me all in one go, and i was looking for something strong to latch onto. then i had the notification from my library - the winner's kiss was finally available!! it must've been fate. surely this was the only book that could follow the emotional turmoil and state of catharsis that feyre and rhysand had left me in. i had so many hopes and expectations for this one. i spent the majority of the winner's crime begging for secrets to be revealed, for reunions, for more, more, more. i expected to be played like a fiddle in this one, watching and praying for kestrel and arin to find their ways back to each other. dreading / craving the deception, heartache, and what else could happen from the new characters. something huge was going to go down, and i was on the edge of my seat anticipating it. the big reveal of kestrel's secret ( s )!! then it started out so choppy. things happened earlier than i expected with much less flare ( or no flare ). the tender moments were there, and i was definitely craving them. loved seeing more of arin. but it was lacking action, spark, and feeling. so, i'm setting the book down. for now. after making it over halfway through and realizing i wasn't enjoying more than a handful of pages so far, i didn't want the series to go out like that. so i'm putting it on the shelf ( technically, back to the library * ), giving myself some time to recover and read a train of mediocre books, then in a few months time i'll give this one a shot again. i'm still numb from acomaf, and it isn't fair for me\n",

      "sam is a \" mean girl \" ( i'm talking the plastics mean, with regina george as her best friend ) who is able to relive the last day of her life seven times over after dying in a car accident. i want to know if oliver grew up in rural connecticut. i did, and not only is this book set in a town that sounds uncomfortably like the one i spent the first 18 years of my life in, but reading this book was literally like walking the halls of my high school all over again. the good, the bad, and the ugly. all of it. it is written flawlessly and honestly. sam's arc as a character is incredible. i felt no sympathy for her at the end of day one, and at the close of day seven, i was crying. ( while on a plane, no less. it wasn't pretty. ) and it's not just sam that is powerful in this way ; every single character has their own layered, complex story. they are shades of gray - no one is completely good or completely evil - and i found this both refreshing and realistic. amazing. amazing. amazing. if you haven't read it yet, no excuses. get out there and buy, rent, or borrow a copy of this brilliant gem. right now. originally reviewed here\n",

      "finally, a return to the quality that the first two books displayed. actually, i shouldn't say that, because this is even better than those two ; it's my favorite of the series so far. clary and jace were surprisingly interesting for once, and the other characters were awesome. and speaking of the characters, the main thing i loved was that the stories were much more character - oriented than the others. the dramatic plot was more of a backdrop behind the character interactions than the other way around, which was quite refreshing. the stronger part was definitely the one in new york ; the one with clary, jace, and sebastian, while nice, was sometimes hard to understand ( there were about 50 pages during which i was fuzzy on sebastian's motives and plans, even though everyone else clearly knew ), and it wasn't as good. the one in new york, however, was excellent. in particular, i liked that magnus and alec weren't the happy couple they might've been in another story, and alec got what he deserved for ever talking to camille. overall, this was a truly excellent book, one that doesn't disappoint. i hope city of heavenly fire can live up to this standard, because this was outstanding.\n",

      "suzanne brockmann specializes in romantic suspense novels. the ones i like best find that balance between the romance and the action, which is not an easy achievement. every reader draws a different line, but for me, when the hero and heroine meet and fall into instant lust ( like one where they were in a dungeon about to be shot as spies ) and go on and on about how hot each other are, then the so - called danger diminishes to a paint - by - numbers plot. nothing bad is going to happen. there will just be just enough mustache - twirling threat to transition between the long sex scenes, with maybe a dose of miscommunication aaaaangst. some readers adore that, but not i. so, here we have peter greene, newly become a single dad, flagging down shayla whitman, a few years older, and mom of two teenage boys. as soon as greene ( who she notices is super hot ) says that he just saw his kid get into a car with two unknown guys, she goes instantly into mom mode, and helps him because the man needs help. not because he's hotter than hot. and aside from one obvious blunder ( view spoiler ) [ even i know that those old cars have removable seats in back so anyone could get into the trunk, but i totally give brockmann a free pass because otherwise there would have been no story ( hide spoiler ) ] the balance between rising tension, character development, and romantic slow - boil heat, is expertly managed. it was a pleasure to watch these two negotiate the landmines of their respective pasts as they dealt with the dangers of the present. teen maddie, peter's daughter, is not only three dimensional, but so is her loser boyfriend dingo. shayla is a writer, and the writerly meta sometimes had me laughing out loud. peter's struggle between his navy seal persona and becoming dad to a girl who hates him was beautifully handled, and in short, this was a terrific, atmospheric, tender, funny, fast - paced read with nail - biting tension at the end, and a sobering dose of real california history that i thought excellently handled. copy provided courtesy of netgalley\n",

[ mopes around the house ] dear readers, i am super excited to be introducing you to my new series today. a series that has taken me on such an exciting journey, i'm so very glad it's only the beginning! it was on a trip to chicago that i first met my hero. he was on a social media page that made the news, and the sight of him startled me. there he was. this ostentatious young billionaire, dark - haired, bare - chested and beautiful, surrounded by half - naked groupies, with more than a million online followers. by the time i returned home a week later, i was still haunted by the look in his eyes. he was a mystery that i simply had to unravel, and when he started appearing in my dreams, i set out to do just that. his name is malcolm saint. as i sat down to get to know this \" manwhore, \" i fell so hard and so irrevocably in love with him. and, now, i hope you will too. this is the first book in the manwhore series and i hope you're ready to catch fire! katy blurb : is it possible to expose chicago's hottest player - - without getting played? this is the story i've been waiting for all my life, and its name is malcolm kyle preston logan saint. don't be fooled by that last name though. there's nothing holy about the man except the hell his parties raise. the hottest entrepreneur chicago has ever known, he's a man's man with too much money to spend and too many women vying for his attention. mysterious. privileged. legendary. his entire life he's been surrounded by the press as they dig for tidbits to see if his fairytale life is for real or all mirrors and social media lies. since he hit the scene, his secrets have been his and his alone to keep. and that's where i come in. assigned to investigate saint and reveal his elusive personality, i'm determined to make him the story that will change my career. but i never imagined he would change my life. bit by bit, i start to wonder if\n",

      "i had met the dynamic alyson noel at anderson's bookstore in naperville, il and purchased the first three books in her riley bloom series. i was excited to read them. but, when a fifth grader came to our house for dinner with her family and saw the novel on my living room table, she absolutely raved about the series! so i knew i had to put radiance on the top of my list. after the family left, i picked up radiance and started reading it. boy was that fifth grader right! radiance is a book about a snarky, brave, determined twelve - year - old girl who has passed away and is now in the here & now. she is assigned a job of being a soul catcher and because of her spunk and self - determination, bodhi, her teacher / guide / mentor, gives her a difficult task of bringing in a troubled and disturbed and terrifying ten - year - old ghost who has been haunting warmington castle in england. bodhi expects riley to fail just like others before her, but don't count riley out! riley is accompanied by her beloved dog buttercup ( also in the here & now ) and adds wonderful humor to the story. though i have just started this series, there are so many things that i love about it already. the beautiful writing that presents the afterlife in a way that shows that death is just another extension of life, that each of us has a purpose and role in life and death, and that we all have the power to help others and do something valuable. magnificently crafted, this series will definitely be a favorite for many middle schoolers and older. can't wait to read more.\n",

      "i loved reading this book. jennifer l. armentrout usually delivers for me because of her memorable characters who are easy to identify with, and her engaging plot lines. the problem with forever has all of that and more. i fell in love with mallory and rider at first sight, and devoured this novel like i was starving. this is armentrout's most diverse work, and i loved loved loved that she showcased some aspects of the hispanic culture with these characters and the setting. sure, there are cliche bits, but the message hit home, and i couldn't get enough of it. the problem with forever is equal parts heartbreaking and sweet, filled with moments when i teared up, caught off guard by the poignancy. and of course, it's filled with humor and the easily recognizable jla feel. i definitely recommend this book to ya lovers, and if you're not a ya reader but appreciate a second - chance romance, then you'll love this too! originally posted on slow reader's blog\n",

      "review brought to you by obs staff member haley beware of spoilers first, i must say that i fell head over heels for born at midnight! i have literally counted the days to the release of awake at dawn. c. c. hunter has a way of grabbing the reader's attention and holding it like few authors can. awake at dawn is without a doubt the perfect sequel to born at midnight! awake at dawn picks up right where born at midnight concluded. kylie is still in the process of trying to figure out what she is and readers will immediately feel a connection to her journey. throughout awake at dawn readers learn more about the people close to kylie and their relationships. kylie begins to change drastically throughout the course of the novel. awake at dawn shows a stronger more resilient kylie. she begins to develop skills that suggest she is many different paranormals. still, the reader is left wondering what exactly kylie is?!? she begins to change so drastically it's hard to know which paranormal she'll end up being. i love the relationship between holiday and kylie. holiday, the camp leader, is always there and always willing to do what she can to help kylie. not because it's what she's supposed to do but because she seems to genuinely care for kylie's well being. it's much like the friendship between kylie, miranda, and della. the friends are an unlikely team. while they have their moments, there hasn't been a truer bond. all three seem willing to go to great lengths to protect each other. it's so refreshing to see such a bond in awake at dawn. i'm thrilled with c. c. hunter's portrayal of such a great friendship! c. c. hunter put the perfect amount on romance in awake at dawn. the relationship kylie has with both lucas and derek is addicting! i found myself falling for both characters. how could anyone choose between the two? derek is the kind, sweet, and handsome half - fairy while lucas is the mysterious, sexy, and all consuming werewolf. i find myself drawn to lucas because he and kylie share a part of their childhood but it's an impossible triangle, nonetheless. awake at dawn follows kylie's journey to self discovery. it's full of the perfect balance of both friendships and romance and will leave readers needing more! it's not often that i love a series as much as i have with the shadow falls series. i find myself thinking of nothing but both born\n",

      "this is done in the style of chaucer's canterbury tales, with 7 pilgrims being selected by the'shrike'to see him on the planet hyperion. the prose is gorgeously written and the characters fascinating. each tale is told in a completely different style, but serve as another tidbit of exposition as to the ending of their journey ( which i've been warned is a cliffhanger ). i'm listening to the audiobook, which has a different narrator for each character... i find the audiobook akin to sitting around a campfire with some particularly good storytellers. so far, i've listened to the first three stories and i cannot wait to continue.\n",

      "definitely recommend for those ya romance readers out there! absolutely loved melissa walker's poignant bittersweet romance unbreak my heart. ( view spoiler ) [ it's about a smart girl named clementine who falls in love with her best friend amanda's boyfriend ethan. ethan and clem have a lot more in common than amanda and ethan, and it's pretty obvious that these two would be much better off together. i don't want to spoil what happens between clem and ethan - - you have to read the novel yourself - - but i will say that the way melissa portrays it, is dead on. why is it that the girl is always blamed for these things and the guys get off pretty much scot - free? and why is it that a girl's self - esteem ends up in tatters? i must say, i love clem's parents. they're just good people. the novel takes place over a summer. clem's family sails down the illinois river meeting wonderful people along the way. clem is still reeling from what happened with ethan. plagued by guilt, she holds herself to such high standards, that she can't forgive herself for destroying her friendship with amanda. along comes james who is sailing the same route with his father. james has his own heartbreak, but he deals with it differently than clem. they change each other's summer, giving new perspective to what it means to truly care about another person. ( hide spoiler ) ] this novel is chocked full of some powerful messages. one that may not be obvious is that friends need to communicate better and not make assumptions, especially when it comes to boys. if ethan had been my son, i would have been on his case so fast and demand he \" man up \" and take responsibility for his actions. guys - listen up. if you like someone more than the girl you're with, break up with her! it's not okay to treat another person this way!\n",

      "i have to say up front that i would not have finished this book if i hadn't felt obliged to because the publisher sent me a beautiful hardcover copy. and in a way i am glad i pushed on, and in a way i'm not. i think the audience it was aimed for - - middle grade and maybe early high school - - will buy into the entire story. the way that makes me sorry - - in fact, to put it stronger, the point at which i nearly tossed the book - - was an astounding moral trespass ( view spoiler ) [ it is clear from context that violet murdered mean - girl jennifer in order to get her husband, greg, whom violet had been lusting after since she was in middle school. ( hide spoiler ) ] and it's pretty much glossed over. i suspect that flinn was counting on a fairy tale feel to slide the reader quickly past that bit, and it will probably work for younger readers used to slick tv moral relativism. another thing that will work for younger readers with no experience of life is how violet, whose ugliness and loneliness in the early chapters is compellingly drawn, stays focused on her ex - friend greg until she's an adult. greg has no personality whatsoever. he's a lust object. even more unbelievable is how he and mean girl jennifer stay a couple all the way from middle school until marriage. greg and jennifer never develop personalities ( jennifer has to stay a one note mean girl forever and greg an utter cipher ), and violet even as an adult juuuuuust waaaaaaaaants greggggg. * cue thirteen year old whining. * that's part one. so the next part concerns celine, who now has violet as a step - mother. violet has now become as boring and one note as jennifer was in the previous part, but when she's not around, celine and especially her short friend goose make the book come alive. and here is where i'm glad i kept reading. this part of the book is terrific. if celine and goose could have had their own book, completely shorn of violet, greg, and jennifer, this would have made an outstanding read for any age - - and the point about how beauty isn't everything would have still been made. in spades. we really don't need the constant hammer of violet's obsession with her own beauty ( and greg ) torquing the story into predictable\n",

      "my 2016 has been dominated, perhaps overly so, by reading along various awards, particularly the man booker international, the goldsmiths prize, the best translated book awards, and the main booker prize. the first three lived up to their usual high standard and the last was a major disappointment, indeed i wonder why i put myself through it every year although no doubt i'll be back next. the mookse and gripes forum has been an excellent place to discuss all of this. my other big focus has been to expand my reading of korean fiction, in translation but the bilingual editions from asia publishers have been very helpful. as of now i'm on 112 books. i won't list them all here ( see my shelf for a full ranking ) but the top 20 are all outstanding and highly recommended. 1 pond by claire - louise bennett - read it. 2 human acts by han kang, even better than her man booker international winning the vegetarian 3 the sleep of the righteous by wolfgang hilbig - the next sebald / krasznahorkai / bolano i. e. discovery in translated fiction 4 son of man yi mun - yol, highlight of my korean reading 5 death by water by kenzaburo oe, another great novel from one of my favourite authors 6 ladivine by marie ndiaye, a wonderful discovery from the man booker international 7 mothering sunday by graham swift, which should have been listed for and won the man booker 8 the boy who stole attila's horse ivan repila, deciptively short and simple 9 transit by rachel cusk, my favourite from my favourite award, the goldsmiths 10 the festival of insignificance by milan kundera, a wonderful present for 2016, a late, probably last, book from a master 11 hot milk by deborah levy, stand out from the 2016 booker longlist 12 autumn by ali smith, give her the 2017 booker now 13 solar bones by mike mccormack, a worthy winner of the goldsmiths 14 a god in ruins by kate atkinson, a great \" companion piece \" to life after life 15 mend the living, maylis de kerangal, another from the mbi 16 signs proceeding the end of the world, yuri herrera, deserved winner of the best translated book award 17 goethe dies, thomas bernhard. a quirky advantage of translated fiction is there are books still to come even from deceased authors, and bernhard is a master. 18 martin john, anakana schofield,\n",

      "sabrina was innocently surfing the internet when she read there was going to be a 3rd installment to the heist society. eager, sabrina went on to goodreads hoping to be given some information on what the book will be about. this was what she recieved :............ sabrina is not pleased. not pleased at all. at least give me the title!!!! gah, i don't think i can wait till 2013 if only this information is given to me : nothing. ally carter, you are killing me! not a single spoiler, nothing. rats! what i hope will happen ~ hale and kat will finally get off their high horses and get together ( cause heaven knows how much longer us readers can wait ) ~ another amazingly - executed heist, as per usual. perhaps it will be in switzerland, in a cave that kat really needed to find ( according to the last book at least ) ~ more bagshaws brothers! love those guys! ~ i have a feeling nick will return in the next book so i am hoping begging that his character will be further developed! please? so, until i get more information, i am going to my room to sulk. and to re - read uncommon criminals and the entire gallagher girls series. sabrina signing out. > edit : november 13th, 2012 sabrina was again, surfing the web when she noticed a pre - review she had written a while ago. curious, sabrina clicked her pre - review to be met with... a cover! the cover : initial reaction : followed by... suffice to say, i cannot wait! and seeing this cover only makes me want need this book even more! digging a little deeper there are some certain things we can get out of this cover like the fact that there's hale in the sunglasses reflection. or who i am assuming is hale, i'd feel pretty damn embarassed if it turns out to be nick or simon. either way, cute guy in the sunglasses reflection! the fact that kat is wearing pink just makes me feel giddy inside... probably just me. and then in their eye, we see a reflection of what looks to be typical nyc taxis. yeah, i'm overanalysing this! anyways, i am so happy we have more information ( like, since did kat and hale become a couple? )! until next time, sabrina signing out!\n",

      "this book had my attention from the first pages. five years ago, five minutes and one call changed abbey's life tragically. she can't remember everything that happened, but is certain of one thing - she's to blame and will have to live with the guilt. abbey is an outsider. any attention she does get is negative. she sees dead people, literally. her home is also her father's business - a mortuary and crematorium. as if being a teenager isn't hard enough. one day she hears a loud caw from a tree. it's a bird, maybe a crow and makes her very uneasy. there are dead bodies in her basement, but this unnerves her more. it should. tanner is abbey's best and only friend. he doesn't fit in either because of an accident years ago that's left in a wheelchair. at first i thought the friendship was one of convenient, but when something devastating happens to both of them, all tanner can think about is how he can help abbey. nate is about to climb denali, the highest mountain peak in north america. he's been looking forward to it his whole life. the night before the climb, he has a terrible nightmare that has now overshadowed his excitement with fear and impending doom. he keeps his fears to himself. it was just a bad dream. right? this book took me by surprise. i thought i had an idea how the story would unfold, but i was completely and pleasantly wrong. every time i thought i finally knew, i was proven wrong again and love that. i'm the type of reader that's always thinking ahead, which wasn't possible with on a dark wing because of the unpredictability and how engrossed i was with what was happening in the moment. while abbey is a main character, she isn't the only focus. all the characters had strong personalities that we get to know through alternating points of view. on a dark wing felt like multiple stories with a common thread. each plot adds to the bigger story and would be interesting on it's own, but make an even more intriguing and captivating one combined. full of suspense and a conclusion you'll never see coming, on a dark wing is a fascinating story from beginning to end. this is the first book i've read by jordan dane, but won't be the last.\n",

      "it's hard to talk about a book like this and say that i liked it. the subject is so overwhelming, that \" like \" just doesn't fit. it absolutely held my attention. i felt a range of emotions throughout the entire book. anger, sadness, fear, sometimes hope, and always disbelief that anyone could go through what kendra had to go through and survive. i can't imagine going through every day life with this kind of pain. how she could be expected to care about school, classes, etc. when she was dealing with the memory of being raped since she was two years old is unfathomable. and to know that her attacker was still out there, ready to hurt her again if she ever remembered and told who he was... i've never read a book about cutting before. i think it was a really good thing for a mother of a teenager to read. it really helped me to understand what goes on in the mind of someone who cuts. the hurt that she is trying to escape from, and yet at the same time is trying to express in a visible way. i think cheryl did a really good job of explaining what kendra was going through, which is not surprising because cheryl has lived though a similar experience herself. the book was a mixture of kendra's irrational thoughts about blame, guilt, and insecurity but at the same time, very logical thoughts about why she was doing what she was doing, and how it really wasn't her fault at all. i think this was a good approach, because if someone is going through this kind of hurt, she will relate to kendra's thoughts, but then will be able to see that she is not to blame, and hopefully be able to see that she can trust people to help her. scars not only dealt with the trauma of rape and cutting, but it also had an element of mystery. the end of the book read like a horror movie. as kendra works to figure out who it was that raped her, letting the memories flood her, and realizes that she is being stalked and threatened by the man who harmed her. my heart was racing as i came to the explosive ending of this book. overall, i think scars a very powerful book. one that would be good for abuse survivors, people who self - injure, and for adults who need to know the signs of abuse that teens are trying to show them but don't know how. i hurt for kendra, and for all children that have gone\n",

      "read more reviews and follow discussions at once upon a prologue! lex bartleby is a self - professed \" equal opportunity bully, \" a girl who goes in two short years from being a model daughter to the terror of her high school. when her parents inform her - after restraining her at the dinner table - that she's being sent to live with her uncle mort for the summer, all hell breaks loose. lex goes, albeit unwillingly, and the real fun begins when she meets uncle mort and they travel to the hamlet of croak, possibly the best kept secret and most unorthodox little town you've never heard of. hilarity, misadventures, and even a bit of romance ensue in debut author gina damico's croak. i was excited to read this book, but when i started it, i was unsure. it hit me what was wrong after about two chapters : this book is in 3rd person, and i've read mainly 1st person point of view books recently, so that in and of itself is no fault of croak. and, the further i dug into the story, the cooler the setting is ( more on that in a minute ). but by far, the point where i fell, heart and soul, for croak... was when i met uncle mort. mort is too cool for words, and i may have squee'ed over him for an inappropriate amount of time. he's not the only well - fleshed out character in the book - he just happens to be the most awesome one. croak is a fun story, considering it revolves around the topic of death. gina damico keeps the action flowing as well as the jokes. there were a few moments where i literally laughed out loud - something completely unexpected amidst this story of a town full of grim reapers, but you see, croak is irresistibly good. gina does a great job at writing not one but several teen characters - under her pen, they seem real, people you'd want to get to know, despite the scythes they carry. croak also brings to life the sleepy town through a vast array of hilarious secondary characters, and gina even managed to surprise me with the identity of the book's villain. my only downsides are really quibbles : i wish several of the characters, mostly the other grims, had been a bit more fleshed out. as awesome as\n",

      "this review was originally posted on cocktails and books it's been some time since i've read an immortal guardians book, but i have to say it was very easy to step back into the ig world and fun to see what had transpired since i last picked up a book. in this installment, the focus is on guardian ethan as he finds himself enamored with a gifted mortal woman as certain members of the \" others \" continue their bid to cause armageddon, using this woman to infiltrate the immortal guardians. i really enjoyed the relationship between ethan and heather. i loved how they met, when she saved him during a fight with some vampires. i loved how understanding he was, when heather explained her gift and why she was so comfortable with him. and i loved how he kept his distance, despite not wanting to, because he didn't want to bring her into his world. he could go alpha male when he needed to, but at his core, ethan was a squishy centered male who wanted nothing more than a woman to love him for exactly who he was. and heather never wavered in her belief that ethan was a good man, despite some of the horrific things she saw and fully understanding just what ethan did. they were the perfect mix together, making me desperate to see them get their hea. as with the other books in this series, the romance isn't the only thing happening in the book. the continued storyline with the immortal guardians trying their hardest to ensure mankind's survival had me at the edge of my seat. i love the suspenseful mix with seth, the other guardians and the human military as they combined to determine what was attacking military instillations. for this particular story, the military tied in perfectly with heather, since her father happened to be a high ranking general who needed to figure out what was happening to his men. the entire storyline had me on edge, as i wondered if heather, her father or anyone one of the guardians were going to get hurt as they tried to determine what was happening. this was a perfect weekend read and jump - started my need to get back into more paranormal romances. dianne duvall always manages to have the perfect mix of paranormal and romance in her books, with shadow strike continuing that tradition. if you haven't read the other books in this series, i do recommend jumping into it. reviewer information can be found under the tags section of the post on our site.\n",

      "it's interesting to read an end - of - the - century novel from the opposite side of the intervening twentieth century, for though there is in chopin's novel no preoccupation with the remorseless cycle of measured time, the intervening hundred years - - and all their evolutions, both cultural and literary - - are going to be part of the modern reader's context. be aware : this is somewhat spoilery. as the novel unfolds, it is very difficult to like edna pontellier. in these days of two paychecks being required just to survive, on top of the endless drudgery of housework, car maintenance, and children's needs, edna's dissatisfaction with a life of social engagements, fine dinners that she did not have to prepare or clean up after, and congenial hours of just sitting about on porches chatting idly, make it very hard for a modern reader to sympathize with her. while she is obsessed with her perceived bonds of slavery, she spares not one thought to the nameless women of color who labor unceasingly in the background doing the drudge work that is an inescapable part of daily existence. the woman who appears to be the primary caretaker of edna's two boys is not even vouchsafed a name ; she is dismissed as \" the quadroon, \" a racial epithet that relegates her to an importance somewhere beneath parlor furnishings, which are at least noticed by callers. chopin's evocative depiction of life in louisiana a hundred years ago is fascinating both for the differences and for the moments that resonate with our own experience. adele ratignole's childbirth scene, with its pain and emotional intensity. the ability of children then, as now, to invent games on the dusty ground. sitting through an amateur theatrical. the sensory details, and the emotional dynamics resultant all transmit that spark of verisimilitude - - the scents of flowers. the stickiness of clothing in hot weather. how musical artistry stabs through our primal emotions like a hiltless knife. the moment of realization when the warmth of friendship kindles into lust. the novel's overarcing theme appears to be self - discovery, but it reads to me more like self - involvement. restless, emotionally stifled edna is \" awakened \" first by madamoiselle reisz's music, and then by a midnight swim when she dares, for the first time, not\n",

      "this review was originally posted on andi's abcs i had heard about anna and the swallow man back in may at bea. i was talking to a friend on the showroom floor and she mentioned the book and it had been in the back of my mind ever since. when i was contacted about reading it for a blog tour i immediately said yes. i knew it would be a tough read thanks to the subject matter and parts of it really were. but it was also just a beautifully written novel about survival. it's hard to say exactly what happened in the book since we all know the stories on what happened in parts of europe in the 40s when ww2 was happening. people were being taken away from their family and their homes and no one would know where they went or if they would return. and this is the position anna found herself in when her father, a single father, was taken away and she was left alone. she was 7. that was the heart of the story for me. this poor 7 year old girl had to navigate through a time in history that hurts to even think about. she had to trust a stranger and make decisions an adult wouldn't want to make and do things i would never want to do. that was what really hit me in anna and the swallow man. and even with all that violence and death and sadness the writing shined through. the author did justice to what they were writing about even though it was difficult to do i would imagine. it was done with tact and class and with a certain kind of beauty. it made anna and the swallow man a hard read but a beautiful read when all is said and done.\n",

      "2016. on reading terms, i think i did pretty well. - i re - discovered books that i love by doing a whole lot of re - reading. - i realized that if i set my mind to it i can read somewhere around 21 books in a month ( with two weeks of vacation of course ). - i re - discovered my love of fanfiction ( if only you could register those on goodreads! ) - i realized that even your most favorite authors can write books that you dislike ( or hate with a fiery passion ) and that's okay. - i 5 starred more books than i rated under 3. - i read fantasy, contemporary, sci - fi, mythology, romance, non - fiction and everywheres in between. - i read middle grade, young adult, and adult. - i also realized that lists are my thing, can you tell? jennifer armentrout is still a insta - buy author, tiger's curse series is still my life, a court of thorns and roses series was un - put - down - able and easy by tammara webber is the best new adult contemporary i have ever read. i had a lot of things happen in my personal and professional life, but books were always there. and with that i read 106 this year, which i am super proud of. i rang in the new year with a book in my face, exactly how i plan on spending 2017. my only resolution is to review more books. i need to get my thoughts on paper ( er.. webpage ) happy reading : )\n",

      "rachel harris does it again with a sweet, adorable romance perfect for young adults who love a a hea between best friends. there are some delicious kissing scenes that will make even the hardest heart swoon. i love how the aly has to learn that the best person to be is herself. that she is a lot more than a makeover and clothes. the fine art of pretending can get even the best girls in trouble, at least with the heart. girls, you are worth much more than a hookup! a swoony, satisfying read.\n",

      "and she has done it again, april tucholke has stumped me again, after reading \" between the devil and the deep blue sea \" i was confused, because lets face, that is one \" original \" book. after reading this book however i must conclude that \" between the spark and the burn \" is even weirder. i love the characters and the writing, the mystery and the crazy... but damn reading this book like doing rat maze in the dark with a blindfold on and with manic giggling coming from behind ever bend in the road and really the whole world is on fire. burning. sparking. glowing. that isn't to say that i didn't like this book, in fact i would go as far as to say that i liked it, really liked it. if she writes another book, i will reading - after thoroughly mentally preparing myself. and really if you have read all the nonsense i have written up to here, i congratulate you and say that really the only thing i have to say about this book is that nothing about it is as you expect, and that the ending is damn near impossible.\n",

      "yet again i will warn you that this is a spoiler review. i can assure you that i would not have wanted to be spoiled on anything in the fiery heart. if any of you have not yet read the fiery heart or any of the bloodlines novels i would suggest skipping over this review and to go pick them up at a local bookstore or library. ( view spoiler ) [ i was thrilled when i learned that the fiery heart would be split in both sydney and adrian's points of views. but, this news also made me really depressed since every book i have ever read that has been split into two point of views in the middle of a series means that something bad is going to happen and the readers will have to see what is going on in both sides. i was correct to assume that i should not be happy for the motivation behind the split point of views. on to the romance. richelle mead had said that there would be so much more romance than there was in indigo spell. she was right. i enjoyed the romance in indigo spell more than the romance in the fiery heart. in the beginning of the fiery heart there was little romance but as the book progressed so did the romance. especially in chapter 17. the reason i believe that i was more into the indigo spell's romance was because compared to the fiery heart it was sweeter. the fiery heart's romance was more intense. with that being said, sydney and adrian are my all time favorite couple from all of the series / trilogies i have ever read. in addition to sydney and adrian's blooming romance, others were blossoming. angeline and trey finally accepted that they are meant to be together regardless of what the warriors of the light think. also, jill and eddie are kind of together. they kissed, but i am not sure if eddie has gotten over the fact that he thinks he does not deserve her because she is a'princess'and he is her guard. truthfully, i just want them to get together already. i want to see olive and neil as a couple. it is hard to tell yet whether or not olive likes neil. but it is obvious that neil is crushing on olive. the most shocking relationship was between ms. terwilliger and malachi wolfe. i loved both adrian and sydney's reaction to the news! when sydney got eddie to teach zoey how to drive i was hoping that zoey would begin to realize how the moroi and dhampires are not that different from\n",

      "charnel's review posted on guilty pleasures 5 stars a shockingly entertaining read. this has to be one of the best short stories i have ever read. casper starts off the book looking for the mysterious hands that keep grouping him around campus. i was immediately drawn into the story wanting to figure out who hot hands is. i was full of anticipation, yelling at my computer many times ; who is it?? i know who he is!! back to who is it?? throughout the short story i felt as though i knew who hot hands was however, the way the story is written and the emotions behind casper's relationship with the most likely \" suspect \" had me second and third guessing myself. i wanted casper to be happy but i didn't want his past to come back and haunt him. it's hard to believe casper and his mystery groper become involved before casper even sees his face but i think it adds excitement and fun to the story. it also made me want to know even more who the man was behind the deep voice and the big hands. i don't think i have ever fallen for a character as fast as i fell for casper. i loved this story beginning to end. i'm recommending this book because i feel like it's a short story that will add a little excitement to the reader's day.\n",

      "kimber's review posted on guilty pleasures book reviews 4. 5 stars i'm glad i read this book........ sort of, and for the record, i am in total agreement with most of what i've heard and read about it. the best way i can describe it is gut wrenching. i loved it and hated it and i wish i could sit down and have a good cry because i don't think i've ever experienced what was going on in my mind, heart, and stomach while i continued to allow these gamut of emotions. i literally could not put it down, didn't want to, but at times i did want it to end because i thought i couldn't take the tragedy of it all any longer. i am completely worn down, worn out, and my heart hurts. the characters are real and true and i lost count of the times i was disappointed in their decisions but i also knew that what they did or said was true to who they were. if the author had painted this pretty picture of them the outcome would have come across as fake and this story is anything but. early on, it's easy to see these characters are meant to be together, but their journey is pure torturous hell. the title is very fitting to this couple. so, if you decide to read it for yourselves, take heed to all the warnings. it is not pretty, uplifting, or the perfect happy - ever - after most of us need / want from our books. i guarantee it will push all of your limits and exceed a lot of them. it is a harsh, authentic, sad, tragic, painful, shocking, powerfully well told story that has attached itself to my soul. i don't know that i will ever be able to erase the mark its left. sounds dramatic, but seriously, it will take me days, maybe longer to move on. if you like your stories dark, edgy, well - written, and welcome the ugly truths of the biker world, you'll be all over this one.\n",

      "incredible window into humanity. post - apocalyptic story after adults and children die from a virus with only teens left. the young world contains a lot of violence and brutality, which is balanced well with humor and romance so it doesn't feel too overwhelming. the post - apocalyptic new york city is described in full detail. anyone who has been to nyc will recognize these places and be able to envision how it is now and what it's like in chris weitz's imagination. he took iconic places and really changed the environment to give it an after - the - world - is - nearly - destroyed feel. the actions of many of the characters are not much different than what we see in society today. people lust for power and those are not the kind of people who make the best leaders. we see sexism, racism, homophobia. depending on the group of ya, the role of young women varies. in one group, teen girls are forced into prostitution, in another they're respected leaders. intellectualism is respected, but can also be a major character flaw, depending on the situation. key insights i pulled from this novel that are applicable to today : 1. treat people how you want to be treated. the golden rule. this doesn't always work. being kind doesn't mean others will be kind back. \" the golden rule \" does brings a sense of humanity to a brutal world. 2. what do we value? life? liberty? power? friendship? money? what we value says a lot about who we are. 3. dwelling on the past doesn't get you anywhere. focus on the now. have hope for a future, even if it seems futile. 4. love is important. it shines light on darkness. it provides hope, comfort. human beings need love, even when there is a good chance it will end. 5. in order to have a civilized society a person's basic needs of food, shelter, water must be taken care of first. 6. there are people who thirst for power and will do anything to obtain it. 7. intelligence is something to be valued, if used to help people. it valued above humanity, it becomes meaningless. 8. we need libraries! 9. violence begets violence. when will understand this? 10. society naturally breaks off into groups. 11. some myths are true, or a variation of the truth. what do we learn from it? 12. know your true friends. who can you rely on? 13.\n",

      "people said this book was sweet and romantic. they weren't kidding. this is the first ya book i have read in a long time where i actually felt like i was back in high school. and that's really saying something, because this book is set in paris and i went to school in, um, rural connecticut. but stephanie perkins is so darn good at capturing that'does he like me?... should i even like him... what the heck is happening here?'internal monologue that it was impossible to not relive the emotional roller coaster that is boys and relationship and dating during teenage years. that conundrum is handled so well it's scary. anyway, moving on... you know that thing that writers are always struggling to nail and agents / editors are always clambering to find? voice? ok, well this book has it. anna is so clearly defined she practically jumps out of this story and flops down on the couch beside you. i initially picked this book up in barnes & noble and started reading. i thought i'd read a page or so. i couldn't stop. because anna is so real. and she was talking to me. and so i left the store with book in hand because i knew i wanted to hear the rest of her story. the sexual tension in this book between anna and st. clair is wonderful. it is sweet and innocent, but so obvious. eventually you want to just shake them both and say \" you like each other... do something about it, already! \" but perkins makes their strung - out relationship very plausible. st. clair is taken and anna has another boy on her mind, and then personal and family dramas come into play and complicate things further. beneath the romantic relationship, though, is a truly wonderful message. about friendship. friendship with a boy you think you might like, or a long - time friendship with your best girlfriend from home, or blossoming friendships with new acquaintances in a foreign place. either way, friendship is a bond that often requires forgiveness and honesty to stay strong. and anna learns this, from numerous people throughout her year in paris. in short, this is a real, true, love story. and while i adore that, what i adore even more is that this is a love story built on friendship. so sweet. so wonderful. just like this book. originally reviewed here\n",

      "this third and last of this series begins with a shocker and a heartbreak. sigrud je harkvaldsson, after thirteen years of waiting for contact from shara komayd, his former partner, sets out alone to solve a crime that strikes very close to home - - after a lifetime of hard strikes. we get to meet shara's adopted daughter taty, and meet the great mulagesh again, as sigrid battles assassins and the divine in order to get justice. the stakes accelerate, and there are some terrific action scenes, vividly described, along with bennett's patented insights into aging, violence, the agony of losing children and friends and family... the end is a heartbreak of another kind, piercingly poignant, ending a truly terrific series. readers could begin here, but i strongly suggest reading the first two books. for one thing, they are excellent, and also, bennett builds on them so very, very well. copy provided by netgalley\n",

      "two of my favorite authors ( john green and david levithan ) come together to write will grayson, will grayson and for some reason it takes me ages to actually read it. unacceptable! this book is both incredibly serious and incredibly hilarious at the same time. i laughed out loud during some passages and in others found myself reflecting on how deep and sincere the story was. the story follows two will graysons, one written by green and the other by levithan, who are leading very different lives until they cross paths in a porn shop in chicago one night. ( trust me, the reason they are both in the porn shop is not what you'd think ). green's wg is a quiet guy with a shut - up and don't care mentality caught between loving and hating his best friend, tiny cooper, who manages to always embarrass him or complicate even the most basic of circumstances ; tiny is anything but small ( massive football player ) and seems to be in love with a new boy every day ( or hour ). levithan's wg is struggling with depression and self - loathing, and can't seem to open up to anyone in his life except for an online friend ( issac ) who he heads off to chicago to meet, only to have his world fall apart. tiny cooper ends up being the central thread in this story - in fact, the book could potentially have been called tiny cooper, tiny cooper. he is annoying but loveable, gracious and yet sometimes selfish. while tiny stages the most amazing high school musical i have ever read in contemporary ya, he manages to help both will graysons step beyond the identities they have assumed so far in life. the wg green wrote may be my favorite of green's mcs ( more than quinten or colin or even pudge ). he is still a little dorky and shy, obsessed with a girl slightly out of his league, but he had this spark of sarcasm in him that i loved. he stood up for tiny and himself. he was often incredibly honest even when his # 1 rule was to shut up. he stood apart from green's other male mcs. and levithan's wg is so mean and then so vulnerable. the depth of his depression is clearly communicated, as well as the struggles he faces each day. i'm not sure i've read a character like him before. and somehow, even with all these weighty topics, the book is a quick\n",

      "karina halle never fails to deliver. her writing is fun, it's dynamic, and entertaining. the debt is heartbreaking and beautiful all at once. the story is gutting. it's harsh, it's in your face, it's fantastic. i'm so proud of authors who step outside the \" expected \" box and delve deeper into real life issues. especially when they keep things current. the debt is all that and then some. i mean who in their right mind writes a romance with terrorism and ptsd thrown in? karina halle that's who, she does it bravely, she does it with eloquence all while making you feel like you can't go on. the story written in dual pov's starts with jessica. it's interesting because i had hoped to read this book over several days. but after reading the first few pages i found myself getting comfortable and gripping the kindle with all my might. because the beginning of the debt is surreal. to much almost to read. our world is in crisis mode and with so many terrorist attacks, it doesn't seem to far fetched to think it will affect one of use directly. so to begin a story with a horrific act of domestic terrorism, while giving us the perspective of the victim, is nothing short of powerful penmanship. some may think they didn't need that part. that it hits too close to home. that it's not important to the romance itself. sure maybe, i guess. but what karina does with her stories is bring them to life in a way that only adds dimension to a sometimes one dimensional genre. not to say others aren't bringing anything new. there is just something more to karina halle's stories that we don't often see. when jessica meets keir i'm worried. i don't actually think keir is going to be good for jessica. it took me a while to warm up to him. i think i was hyper - protective of jessica after everything she went through. i wasn't sure another broken / damaged person was going to be a good fit. but as usual karina halle proved me wrong. the chemistry was off the chart. the bond created between the couple was mesmerizing to read. this is a painful book to read. there's a lot of issues these characters are dealing with. almost too much at times. while the romance is hot and sexy, the story really is\n",

      "just finished rock wedding by @ authornalinisingh and boy was it beautiful. this is one of the best books i've read this year. so heartbreakingly beautiful. now abe and sarah are a couple who absolutely deserve a second chance. since the inception of this series, abe was always the drug and alcohol addict. we knew something really painful happened in his past, and in this book we find out what. to be honest, i wasn't a fan of molly and foxy's book rock kiss, but i'm so glad i kept at it and continued the series, because each book was better than the last. and rock wedding was the best of all. sarah and abe are both really strong characters with a painful past, and i loved seeing them grow. not just individually, but also as a couple. the first time their relationship broke apart was largely abe's fault and his actions were'atrocious'( shout out to li'l tessie ). but the way he redeems himself is commendable. throughout the book the man is determined to be better. he made me swooning. the love he has for sarah is indescribable. he definitely earned his second chance fair and square. this book was also a tear - jerker. from the beginning till the end it made me bawl and sob and shed silent tears. it also made me laugh and made my heart go pitter - patter. so thank you @ authornalinisingh for this gem of a book.\n",

      "i finished malice by the excellent john gwynne whilst at hospital with celyn this week. it's taken me a very long time to read due to the many calls on my time, so i've read it in small chunks over many months - and that's exactly the opposite of how i would want anyone to read my own work. it's a particularly bad way to read complicated books, and with a grrm - sized cast and many point - of - view characters this is a book that really needs your attention on it or you'll get lost in the whirl of names and places and politics. even so the story was still able to come to an exciting head for me in the closing stages with all manner of battles, betrayals and revelations. i particularly enjoyed the battle scenes and duels. you get the feeling john knows a lot about swords and swordplay ( no idea if he does or not ). i would call this an'old style'book that reminds me of much of my reading as a teen but brought up to date in the same sort of way that michael sullivan has done with his work. we see an on - coming'god - war'/ wide spread crisis as the first tremors of it reach into the lives of a collection of characters ( mostly young men ranging from low - born to noble ) scattered across the many nations of this world. there are intrigues and mysteries and we're often not sure who can be trusted. various potential heroes grow over the period of ( possibly a year? ) and have their mettle tested. the reviews on goodreads have been great and i can see a big readership for the book. hopefully a us release will come along soon! if it sounds like your thing... then it probably is : d join my 3 - emails - a - year newsletter # prizes..\n",

      "this book was a july 2015 top pick on heroes and heartbreakers http : / / www. heroesandheartbreakers. com... my best of july has to be sommersgate house by kristen ashley. i've been catching up on old books in my kindle and this one blew me away. set in a gothic mansion in england, it has ghosts, funny inhabitants and a hot brooding hero ; basically a perfect read. douglas is lord of manor and due to tragic circumstances gets custody of his sister's children, along with julia. julia is american, warm, funny and awesome, she's everything the children ( and douglas ) need. the story pulls at your heartstrings while delivering a passionate, fun romance. it has that amazing kristen ashley familiar feel with a british twist. highly recommend for even the non - paranormal readers.\n",

      "i'll admit that i didn't love the first book in this series as much as other stories brighton has shared with the world. which i hate saying, because as you've seen me say before, i'll read anything she writes. she's never done me wrong when it comes to hot boys. and let me tell you that while ghost was hot, he never really did it for me. but riley? riley can come over and whisk me away to safety any freakin'time he pleases. because damn. swoons galore. galore. i'm getting ahead of myself, though. we'll come back to riley later. if you've read captive, you'll remember that riley is ghost's younger brother. and in this companion novel, the story focuses all on him and a girl - - the girl - - from his past. evie. the one who got away... kind of. i am a total sucker and a half for once - lovers stories, and these two just about killed me dead. i won't go into the details because spoilers, but i'll say that the story unfolded so well, and the sensitive topics were treated with the respect they deserved. evie's story felt real because it was. she wasn't just your everyday cliche'd character with a bad past. she had reasons for what she did that went beyond the \" i was abused so i'm fucked up \" trope that's so often seen in new adult novels. i was so very happy with the way everything turned out, and i'll say that i thought the blurb on the jacket didn't do the book justice at all. there was so much more inside these pages than i expected. can we move back to riley now? okay. he was so very unexpected. i've been reading brighton's words for a long time, and she's made me swoon before, but it's been a while since i've swooned like this. he did everything right. even when he did that one thing that broke my heart but made me swoon like crazy anyway. and his mouth. the sparring. the sweetness. the... all of it. all. of. it. don't wait to pick this one up when it hits the shelves, for real. just get it and read because you won't be sorry.\n",

      "this review of passenger also appears on ashelynn's bookshelf. i really enjoyed alexandra bracken's the darkest minds series ( although i haven't read the last book because i suck at reading series ) and i was excited to pick up passenger, which is about time travel. if you know me, you know time travel is one of my favorite subjects and i devour books about it. the ability to time travel in passenger is really unique, in which the person has possess the genes to travel through time. so not everyone is able to time travel. those who can time travel have to find passages - and the passages only go to a certain period, like say america in 1776. it's the same day, just the year and location change. i love that concept. i also love that the book is written in third person, and the story is narrated between etta and nicholas. ya is dominated with first person, so passenger is a nice break from the constant \" i. \" i also think it's extremely hard to do a well dual pov book in first person ; in third person, i never have problems with figuring out who is narrating the scene. etta finds out during a concert - she's a violin prodigy - that she possesses the ability to time travel... by travelling through time. she is summoned by the head of a family, ironwoods, who are one of four families who can travel through time. etta obviously belongs to one of the families, but because of her mom, rose, etta doesn't know the truth - like who her father is, or time travel, or anything. grandfather, head of the ironwood family, summoned etta to him because he needs her to find an astrolabe that rose hid - and she left behind a cryptic note that only etta can read. also etta has only a few days to find it and oh yeah, her mom has been kidnapped by the ironwoods. y'all, this plot is the best. i love cryptic notes. i love that it's like a giant puzzle piece. etta and nicholas, who is her companion and the bastard son of one of the ironwoods, race through the passages as they decode the message rose left behind and also slowly figure out that hey, maybe it's not a good idea to give the astrolabe to the ironwoods. passenger has intrigue and secrets, and etta unravels the story behind her mom\n",

      "this impressive debut novel is set circa 1970 in the mountain community of baines creek in the appalachian mountains in nc. weaving back and forth in time, we get point of view chapters from the various denizens of this town scratching for survival, centered around sadie blue, seventeen, pregnant and two weeks into her marriage to roy tupkin. her grandmother and elderly neighbor tried to warn her, but she was stubborn : two weeks into her marriage, after enduring brutal beatings, sadie knows she has made a mistake. we also see life through the eyes of her grandmother gladys, who knows plenty about drunken, abusive husbands - - and her good - hearted neighbor marris, who had an excellent husband, but he's dead. slowly the viewpoints spiral out to the preacher eli perkins, who really is a saint, doing his best for sinner and faithful alike, and kate, shaw, the new teacher in town, with whom he forges a friendship despite her being an unbeliever - - and in spite of his sour sister prudence, jealous with deadly bitterness. then there is birdie rocas, the local wisewoman... oh, i think it would be a mistake to get too deeply into the story in this review. it's best encountered one chapter and person at a time, as the tale winds as slow and inevitable as the seasons around sadie blue and her story. the prose is full of local dialect, richly vivid, evoking the sights and smells and seasons in those deep mountain valleys. the reader gets to know every dish, every piece of furniture, every worn and mended rag, and what they mean as these people survive at the edge of the filthy coal mining industry that mars the stunning and wild beauty. it's a remarkable tale, like nothing else - - immensely unputdownable until the quiet knell of the end. copy provided by netgalley\n",

      "powerful and unforgettable. i suspect that i'll be thinking about leonard peacock for years to come. forgive me, leonard peacock is a novel that imagines some of the pain that might be in the mind of a young adult who makes the decision to kill another person, and then himself. murder / suicide. leonard peacock's story is revealing, heartbreaking, ultra - charged with enough emotional power it could light up a city. it's a warning to parents, teachers, friends. it's a mirror, reflecting perhaps someone we know or just a nameless person in our society who has the potential to become a headline. for me, this novel shows us our responsibility to not just care, but to take action. like herr silverman did. do not ignore children! pretty much every adult did, even those who were concerned weren't equipped to help. not easy. forgive me, leonard peacock is important. perhaps if parents, teens, and teachers read this book it would show them that there are options, that there is a responsibility to not turn away, to see warning signs. ultimately, this is a novel about hope. that there is a way to get out of the hell of darkness and find some light, even when people you love fail you. there is hope. there is still love, even if it hasn't been found yet. that might sound a little trite, but read this novel and you'll understand the full impact of what it means. put forgive me, leonard peacock on your must - read list. it's an important book.\n",

      "reading gr reviews has become my guilty pleasure that takes up the time which may as well be spent on reading books. anyhow, among the books i've read, the highlights are : shakespeare i keep reading and rereading shakespeare. this year, i read all the eight books in his war of the roses series - - i had only read richard iii previously. especially loved richard ii ( my review ) dramas other than shakespeare modern : six characters in search of an author brilliant! ( my review ) classic : prometheus bound ( my review ) nonfiction how to talk about books you haven't read by far, the most insightful essay on the nature of reading. ( my review, or rambling ) also, thanks to this book, i reread hamlet and i am a cat. quick read the book of tea ( my review ) longer read metamorphoses by ovid ( my review, which focuses on the comparison of translations ) yes, i like ancient greco - roman classics. i enjoyed the golden ass, too, especially this linked translation. i didn't find any contemporary ( say, published after 1950 ) novels that was compelling enough to finish. to me, they all seem same old, same old, based on the same values and thought patterns. classics are fresher to me. for instance, in das torikaebaya - monogatari ( i read it in japanese, but put my review here ), when an unmarried princess is found pregnant, people don't blame her, like you'd expect in western stories. they only wonder who the father is - - the princess is attended day and night and nobody has seen a man visiting her - - and try to figure out how she can have safe labor. ( giving birth to a child in the palace was highly unusual. ) it was the best gender - bender novella i've read, even though it was written some 800 years ago. but if you have book recommendations, please let me know. i'm always looking for great reads.\n",

      "( too old to rate ) you don't have to be a classics major to tell that, however different their ambitions as a state was, the roman empire modelled its culture after ancient greece, with thinly - copied gods and regurgitated philosophy. virgil's the aeneid easily falls into this camp, being an attempt at creating a roman version of the homerian epic. virgil adapts ( which sounds much nicer than \" plagiarizes \" ) in reverse : the story begins as an odyssey - esque tale of a displaced wanderer on a cruel journey interspersed with occasional encounters with cruel women, and then morphs into an epic war - story complete with heroic epitaths and details of just about every soldier and their noble deaths. but simple copies and re - appropriations don't often find themselves into the canon in the way that the aeneid has. the reason for this is that, while virgil is obviously aping homer's style, he apes it very well, and is more or less a match for the ancient greek in terms of poetry. his story also seems more condensed and focused than its forebearers, having a much stronger central plot and less digressions. the major difference between virgil and homer is in thematic comment. virgil is more or less a propagandist, establishing a glorious lineage and mythic destiny for the roman empire. this compares poorly to the more nuanced ideas of homer : even at its most epic, the iliad doesn't pick sides in its battle, and portrays the actions of men as the futile whims of more powerful beings. homer's characters are heroic, but he has no illusion about the ultimate effect of this heroism, whereas virgil glorifies both ends and means. both are obviously important texts that reflect their era and culture well, while not page - turners, have moments of beauty in them that a modern reader can still appreciate. if virgil isn't quite as good as homer then, well, who is?\n",

      "this review was originally posted on cocktails and books this was my first pepper winters'book and if i said i was nervous that would be only slightly the truth. i was a bit weary and apprehensive. i usually stay within my genres and favorite authors and don't delve into gritty, dark, books but i trusted my book friends ( thanks ladies ) and dove in. i loved it. every single chapter. i was hooked and couldn't put it down. ruin & rule is a story of vengeance and the kind of love that you only experience once in lifetime. the kind that wrecks you, changes you and never leaves you. arthur \" kill \" killian is on a mission to bring down the people who ruined his life and killed the love of his life so long ago. he is broken to the point that you wonder if ms. winters will be able to put him back together again. he is the president of an mc who seems to have no remorse for any of his actions. his actions are razor sharp and focused and he doesn't care what it takes to get to his end game. the book opens with mc business taking place and it is brutal. ms. winters dives right into the topic of human trafficking and she takes you on a ride. you see all of this through sarah / cleo's pov. she wakes up in a strange place not knowing even her name and quickly understanding that she is a world of trouble. she is one of the girls being trafficked. she can't understand how she even ended up in this situation and how she is going to get out. the minute she meets kill she feels a connection. what can that be? how could she know him? the questions go on and on in this one until the last page. i don't want to give too much away because you really need to read this one. i kept turning page after page trying to figure out where this story was going. i talked it out with my husband. any guesses i had wasn't close to where ms. winters ended up taking me. she throws curveball after curveball and i now can understand why she has such loyal fans. as far as dark, i didn't think this one was too dark but what she did deliver was a fast paced, crazy, thrill ride! i will be picking up more of ms. winter's books and i can't wait to see where kill and cleo's story is going.\n",

      "this is a very difficult book to review. the author did such a tremendous job getting inside the mind of a 5 year - old, one who has never seen the world besides through a tv and what his mother's told him, that we absolutely believe it's him narrating the terrible events. that surely is a credit to donoghue ; she built a masterful tale and gave voice to a hard to create, even harder to male believable, character. on the other hand... she did it so well that the result is he is a 5 yo. narrating an entire novel. that gets annoying. i feel like an insensitive jerk for saying this but the truth is that i got so annoyed at this kid in several points of the narrative! and i was listening to the audiobook, in which the narrator does a spot on job with the voice and way of speak of a child - - so good, in fact that it starts piercing your ears after a while. i wanted to reach the end and know what would happen next but every now and then i just had to stop and give myself a break from it... as much as you love children, listening to one telling a story for over 5 hours ( i listened to the unabridged version, which is over 10 hours, at 2x speed ) is not for everyone. the story is well constructed and feels, unfortunately, too real, considering how many real life cases we've heard about in the last few years of this kind of horrid thing happening. i liked that we got to see so much of life after the escape, and how every one felt so, so real. so flawed, so wrong, so trying their best. you know, real people. this is, to sum it up, an impossible to rate novel for me. it is so good that it's terrible ; it's so well written that it's disgusting, raw, hard to swallow.\n",

      "this was amazing. such a fantastic exciting sff read. in a future canada toronto has collapsed - - no food, no electricity, the city a no go zone of survivors just getting by, and ruled by a malevolent crime lord who uses dark magic to get his way. the story centres on one young woman from a caribbean family whose grandmother is a healer and communicator with the old spirits, plus and the motivating plot driver is the canadian pm's need for a donor human heart for a transplant. the modern / futuristic and magical elements are perfectly blended. what i liked most about this book is ti - jeanne, our heroine. she's not a character who usually gets to be the centre of things : she's a young black single mother with a no - good druggie as babyfather, living at home, no future, no drive. that's a character who normally gets to be set dressing or tragic early victim, at best a white saviour's prop. here, she's the heroine, and ti - jeanne's journey to find courage, trust herself, and grow into a powerful woman is just glorious to read. this is very much a book about strong women, women fighting together, flawed and difficult women who make mistakes, but are, in the end, the ones who are going to * sort this shit out *. oooh it was a joy. * wriggles * a really compelling read and the caribbean magic is wonderfully done. highly recommended.\n",

      "* i received a copy of this book from the publisher via netgalley in exchange for an honest review. thank you so much! * it was a life of crime, a world of violence where danger constantly forced its way in. it was a world that turned men cold and cynical as they did unspeakable things she couldn't fathom. i'm very glad that i requested this book on netgalley. i would have missed out on a great book. sempre is a clash of genres combining an epic love story, high school romance, mafia crime novel and a story about a slave girl on her way to freeom. this is a very emotional book. i was choking up numerous times throughout the first 10 % of this book already. darhower described haven's situation with cool and simple words. the way haven talked about her own destiny, almost detached and totally accepting. it was frightening and so very sad. but when asked once what she was most afraid of she answered it was hope. and then i understood. when she comes to the demarco household, she can't believe yet that things might be better for her. but she eventually gets to know carmine and dominic, the sons of her new master. and let me tell you, there hasn't been a hero like carmine before. he's hilarious, so very cynical, totally messed up, closed - off to his family and hurting inside like hell. i enjoyed the way he and haven got close and fell in love. there are so many great and complex characters in this book. there are hardly any truly bad guys. you might hate some first or they might scare you. but then darhower gives you a closer look at them and few are ever how they appeared first. carmine's father vincent is the best example for that. the world vincent lives in is almost indescribable. it's so dark and brutal, every false step leading to death or torture. it was depressing and shocking in many ways. this novel might be about young adults but it's certainly not for teenagers. sempre is a dark, honest and starkly beautiful story about modern - day slavery and the power of love. everyone with a heart for romance novel should read this book! i'm eager to read the second one soon. i'm so glad darhower decided to write a sequel. because as much that i loved those characters, they're still so young and broken. there\n",

      "i've officially been listening to this audiobook for over a year and i finally finished it! audiobooks are tough for me - i'm a fast reader so i tend to get impatient listening to audiobooks - but i do like them when i'm walking / working out. yes please was so much fun to listen to every time. it really makes you feel like you're amy poehler's best friend and she's sitting down to share all these stories with you. the stories range from funny ( rejected names for leslie knope ) to personal ( her relationship to her family and her divorce ) and touch on everything in between. i loved all of the guest stars she got to read chapters, too - her chapters with seth meyers and michael schur made the audiobook particularly special for me. this is one of the better celebrity books / memoirs i've read, and i'd highly recommend the audiobook for any amy poehler fans!\n",

      "originally posted on three little birds book blog this is what they mean when they say a love story is epic. this is what they mean when they say writing is lyrical and poetic. this is what they mean when they say that a world comes alive. the wrath and the dawn by renee ahdieh is luxurious and beautiful story that's as poetic as a song. i fell in love with this book after reading the synopsis, and because the cover is gorgeous, of course. but then hype killed all my motivation and i was distracted by other books. then i pushed it even farther back because it's a series and i didn't want to experience the torment of waiting for new books to release. so, why did i read it now? i'm a flake and i change my mind a lot. i'm still not sure it was a good i idea to read it because now i'm dying for the rose and the dagger. dying. this book is everything that the synopsis promises it to be, and so much more. it's an intensely romantic love story, a forbidden love story, an enemies - to - friends love story that's layered with political intrigue and intense tension. the slow - burn crackles with electricity, and the plot of interwoven stories is thoroughly engaging. the world that renee ahdieh creates unfolds like the most colorful tapestry, vibrant and detailed. i loved the richness of the setting, and was enchanted by this whole new world... ( yeah, i went there. ) above all else, it's the romance that enchanted me the most. it was truly, deeply, deliciously romantic, and renee ahdieh's exquisite writing blew me away. her beautiful words made made what would've been a great story over - the - top amazing. i can't say enough about how intoxicating her words are, i can only urge you to read them. the wrath and the dawn, a new favorite of mine, is a fascinating tale about love and revenge, and features an unforgettable heroine and beyond irresistible hero. this story is also about friendship and the ties that'll make us do whatever it takes to protect the ones we love. renee ahdieh is a talented new author and i can't wait to see what she has in store for these characters that i absolutely fell in love with. this book is brilliant and i highly recommend it to everyone. is it may yet?\n",

      "read this one on the beach. fantastic book! full review coming soon. _ _ _ final review : in april, i went to florida with a group of friends, and saw the ocean for the first time. it was an amazing trip, and when we all decided to spend one day just laying around on the beach ( which was fantastic, and i miss it! ) i brought one book with me : lola and the boy next door. it only took one reading of stephanie perkin's break - out debut novel, anna and the french kiss for me to fall in love with perkin's writing, as so many others before me had. within a few pages of lola, with the sun overhead and the waves crashing nearby, i sunk happily into lola nolan's story, and experienced all over again the rush of reading a truly amazing book, which has that inherent, mysterious power to wake me up and make me feel. by the end of lola, i'd laughed, cried, seethed, clapped, and generally ran the gamut of emotions. only stephanie perkins can create these amazingly identifiable characters, the kind of girl that, right away, you want to know and befriend. you want to give her advice, you want to go shopping with her, in lola's case, and you just want to know her and go on her journey with her. lola is an incredibly vivacious character, who reminded me of myself at times. i dress conservatively at work because i have to, but there's definitely a part of me that, like lola, loves to dress up it outlandish costumes and jewelry, accessories, and such. and the best part about lola and the boy next door is that there are so many fascinating characters - from lola's two days ( each of which i adored in different ways ), her absentee birth mother, her rocker boyfriend, and of course the infamous bell twins, calliope and cricket. each character reads as if perkins paused in their creation and really gave them time and attention, crafting not just one or two stand - out characters, but many. for lola, who has spent a great deal of her life trying to understand the bell twins, their arrival back in her life throws her into a serious turmoil. suddenly she has to figure out where she stands with both of them, and she ventures down an inspiring course of self - discovery in the process. along the way, lola's relationships with almost everyone around her change, alter\n",

      "this is a good companion to the novels. not only does it expand the map of caelena's adventures but it also gives us a glimpse of characters that might be pivotal in aiding or hindering the rebel's cause. during her time as an assassin caelena traveled far and wide, made some friends and perhaps enemies too. but given that caelena showed mercy to her enemies, it may be that they could turn into allies in the end. it also sheds some light to the very problematic relationship caelena had with her tyrannical master arobynn and the love she shared with sam. ( view spoiler ) [ i couldn't finish. i stopped at what is perhaps her last happy memory of sam. before everything goes to hell. i will read the end when caelena has finally taken her vengeance on arobynn, who i am sure was behind it all. the king and arobynn are so much alike... manipulative, cunning, outsmarting everyone in their own game. i hope they both get what they deserve. i think that all her good deeds may benefit caelena in the end. it's quite possible the pirate and even the red queen, will become her allies. ansel hates the king too. perhaps she's been bidding her time in the flat lands and when she sees her chance, she may take it. and the pirate doesn't really hate caelena. i bet he even admired her bravado and will be ( warily ) happy to see her again. so that - along with her friends in the red desert and the healer ( who may be now prominent in her own right ) - gives her many old acquaintances to revisit should she be in need to travel.

      "emotional hard hitter. enjoyed the characters and romance just like i do other jla books. def worth the time, though i will say that it was a lot of characters to hit me with at once. i connected with lena on a personal note because of the way that she avoids confrontation and of course her love of reading. i totally feel her that sometimes a book can easily trump a party. i loved the romance between her and sebastian. the friendship built into love over so much time. its hard to see that they are both in denial, but it draws things out and it gets them closer. this is a close look at guilt, grieving, realizing that every choice has a consequence, falling prey to the mindset that mistakes never catch up to you, and that sometimes even when you think that \" it'll never happen to me \" that bad things always happen to other people, that one bad choice, one time of not speaking up or listening to your gut instincts can effect much more than yourself.\n",

      "originally posted on slow reader's blog glorious. this book is absolutely glorious. i'm so in love right now, i can barely function. this memoir is unquestionable one of the most engaging books i've ever read, filled with such greatly vivid and riveting anecdotes, made more profound and unforgettable by the fact that they're true. i don't watch the daily show, other than a few occasional clips on social media, and i never followed this guy before, so i decided to read this book solely because of the title. i love it. born a crime - - it just feels meaningful. and, it is meaningful. i'm walking away from this experience knowing now that i love trevor noah. i love his writing and i love his wit. he is a fantastic storyteller who told of his childhood, one that was layered heavily with sadness, but for the majority of the time while reading his journey, i felt joyous. this memoir is a compilation of notable anecdotes, mixed in with short passages of african history for context against the very special circumstances of trevor's birth and childhood. let me tell you, his childhood is better than any fiction and there are too many humorous and affecting moments to count. some of my favorites include, the time when a criminal, young trevor, who was being held prisoner in his grandmother's house ( for his own good ), crawled through a hole under a fence to get to freedom. then, there's the time when his first dog, fufi, taught him his first lesson in love and betrayal. or, the time when, after growing up on the kind of creative diet that only the very poor are weaned on, trevor was left completely unimpressed with high cuisine meals such as bone marrow, which are no different or better than the dog bones he ate at home. for more funny and interesting stories, read this book! born a crime begins before his birth, when his impetuous and wise mother convinced her kind, white neighbor to give her a baby, during a time when there were strictly enforced laws that prohibited intercourse between natives and europeans. the stories he describe span from that time to the end of apartheid, and further to a time when blacks and coloreds were free to live the life they could wrangle from the system. trevor's - - i'm calling him trevor because i feel like i know him now. his thoughts on race and\n",

      "a fascinating read about a woman who gets forgotten when you can't see her. so she can't make friends because when they sleep they forget, but if she can hide out of sight for five minutes, the hired killers will forget what they're doing looking for her and wander off. she remembers though, and is constantly having to battle between her memory of what someone is to her and the reality that they're a stranger. it's a terrific premise and an incredibly bleak one. hope's desperation to be remembered, the way her situation forces her into manipulating and abusing people, and the power she has to do so, are really striking, but mostly her loneliness is agonising. the story is paired with a plot about an app that makes people perfect by erasing their personality which was more interesting intellectual counterpoint than successful thriller to my mind. i read this shortly after the first fifteen lives of harry august and went on to touch and the three together make a fascinating meditation on what we mean to people and what they mean to us and how much our memories are what make us human, and humane. a terrific writer.\n",

      "at first glance, this is a basic coming of age story. cath heads off to college where she struggles to find herself, navigates a new landscape, and deals with all sorts of relationship drama ( family drama, friend drama, boy drama ). but beneath that, rowell has created something very special. reading this book let me relive falling in love for the first time. the butterflies, the warm fuzzies, the constant, palpable tension. ( i'm starting to suspect that this is where rowell really shines - crafting honest, heartfelt relationships, showing us that a touch can be just as sexy as a kiss. ) there's also some strong female friendships in this work that make me want to sing. and let's not forget that cath writes fanfic - simon snow fanfic, to be exact, which exists in a world much like harry potter. my inner nerd was on cloud nine. all the fandom gems are icing on an already very delicious cake. this is a new adult novel that no one should miss come september. originally posted here. note : this review is based on an arc.\n",

      "i've heard this book compared to harry potter. ( yeah, i'm with you - i'm immediately suspicious of anything that gets compared to harry potter. ) in this case, comparing the two would be like saying because a wagon has four wheels, it is exactly like a car. wrong. here are the similarities between half bad and harry potter : an english author wrote a book that has witches in it. that's it. the similarities end there. mainly because while harry potter has an underlying tone of fun and moments that make you laugh out loud, half bad is dark and somber from page one. i'm the first to admit that dark and scary don't always sit well with me. as a kid, reruns of the twilight zone creeped me out. i still refuse to take a shower if no one is at home and going to my first horror movie with a friend in college scarred me for life. i still get occasional nightmares from it. ( okay, that last one's a slight exaggeration, but not by much. ) so it will come as no surprise that parts of half bad were difficult for me to read. violence makes me squeamish. fear for what would happen next kick started my heart rate into high gear. even now as i think back on it, i'm wondering if i'll be able to read the rest of the series because i doubt it's going to get any lighter from here on out. and yet, the story is so addictive, so compelling. the beginning starts off in second person, which i found highly annoying. thankfully, it moves to first person before long. and once i got into it, it was impossible to stay away. the whole premise of good and bad gets turned on its head and makes me very curious to know where this story will end up.\n",

( quite a feat. ) while some of the foreshadowing was obvious and the ending easily predictable, it didn't make me like the book any less. this is the kind of book you read for its classic, timeless feel and its incredible prose. fans of fantasy and fairytales should not miss it. originally posted here.\n",

      "first off we are getting two bear's story so be warned this is going to be a cliffy!!! but i have come to terms with that as that means we get more bear, moving on!!! king series has been my favorite new series of the year and tracey my fave new author of the year. so you can imagine i have high expectations for this series. we are introduced to bear's family father an asshole we already knew that but it's taken up a few notches here and his mother well..... i've always liked bear, his loyalty is irrefutable which is why king will do anything to help him. he first meets thia as a 10 year old she had balls even back then her tragic childhood is what brings her to bears door. bear is on a destructive path due to what happened to him in tyrant ( yes you do need to read king and tyrant ) you should anyways because they are great books. king and ray feature in this book love and miss my king. he's willing to soldier up for bear if needed. ghost preppy makes his appearance also love and miss him. because pancakes. this story has so many'what the fuck, what the hell'moment it will have you reading quicker than you normally do because you need to know where the fuck is this heading. you will finish this story with more questions and wonder what the hell just happened. a sign of a good writer is when you are left wanting more. my high expectations has been met. this has been left on an obvious cliffhanger and of course a what the fuck moment. bring on soulless!!!! * arc provided by the author for an honest review * for more reviews, news and giveaways, check out saucy reviews on kinky korner at ; blog | facebook | twitter | pinterest | instagram\n",

      "unfortunately due to the dark demonic nature of some content and sexual violence triggers i wasn't able to finish this one. story is great if you can handle it. excerpt from my review on book 1 : \" terry goodkind is a sick genius, who if he wasn't writing books would probably be hiding people in his basement. this book is so good, but also so horrible! goodkind is a brilliant writer, who weaves a dark, terrible fantasy that pulls you in and holds you there until its finished with you. this is not a series for the faint of heart, its full of every awful thing that you can imagine. he makes you fall in love with his characters and then forces you to watch while he drags them through the darkest depths of hell. additionally there are so many sexual - violence triggers its a miracle i made it through the first book in one piece. i haven't read anything else by him so i am not sure if it's his style but i truly hope, if these characters survive all the terrors that goodkind is going to put them through, that he gives them a well - earned happy ending. \"\n",

      "this book is a pleasure to read for the following reasons. first, it's long. we're talking days of escapism. with this book, you can draw it out as a reward for doing your day - to - day life while looking forward to reading the next chapter at night before bed. second, it doesn't drag anywhere and a lot happens. so you look down at your kindle, fearing you might be more than halfway through and realize to your delight that you're only 23 % done. third, the supporting characters are an absolute delight. no one lavishes such care and complexity on supporting characters quite like jordan does. my personal faves here are probably the math wizard ( modest, yet dazzlingly competent ), and jia ( flinty no - nonsense integrity ). but i'm fascinated by kevin for his gangsta - speak, loathsomeness, and ability to generate huge, nail - biting tension. and who could forget francis ( aka \" foxy \" ) who was so memorable in his small scene? fourth, the reality show concept is extraordinary. i haven't watched a reality show since the original survivor when the nudist guy won ( ha, ha! ) but this is such good stuff here with the magicians jammed into their fishbowl of a mansion with no privacy and ever - present attempts to manipulate reactions out of them. the production crew is made up of strong characters with no scruples about trying to shape, script, and fake alliances, romances, and animosities among the magicians to boost the ratings. the challenges themselves are full of surprises, suspense, and strong emotion - - i mean, my heart just sank for poor ricardo when he found out the full details for his ring challenge. fifth, the ( view spoiler ) [ subtle supernatural thread that runs through the completely down - to - earth, contemporary narrative ( hide spoiler ) ] is a total page - turner for me. i'm talking about the ( view spoiler ) [ truth. it's beautifully developed to be tricky and have its limits ( as in communicating with inanimate objects ). so the magicians who can tap this spark of real magic are far from omnipotent - - and they open themselves to a terrifying risk of drawing \" spite, \" that is, a karmic destructiveness that rebounds on a magician when he works true magic ( hide spoiler ) ]. sixth, the main characters are deeply appealing. ricardo the\n",

      "i've longed for this book for so long!!! after i've read the selection series, i managed to find other books by kiera cass, and i found the siren! but... this book wasn't available then... it was already out of sell. however, after few months... the book was announced to print again!!! and with a brand new beautiful cover! i love this cover so much! i just love the blue ocean, the dress, and the back cover. it all looks so great together! love is a risk worth taking. well... it's not like the other siren book i've read before. they're mostly about romance, killing and all the other things. yet in the siren... things are quite different. there aren't many killing and singing parts, nor does it has a lot of romance. really, there aren't much of it. it's definitely not love at first sight, or saving boys from the wreck. their love came gradually. i'm not quite sure how to express my feeling about this book, it's not bad... but not as exciting as the selection. there isn't love triangle... which is perfect... but the relationship between kahlen and akinli seems so little. it's even a little bit hard to believe that they're in love. it's more like destiny... you know? that me count... they actually just spent three to four days together... and... that's all. seriously... is that how you feel in love? so soon? but akinli does have a great personality... without doubt... he's a kind boy. what we read more is kahlen's struggle and her bitterness. like it spent about have of the story to describe her night mare, her terrified, her tortured... and things like those. oh! and her siren sisters... their sisterhood... but... i feel nothing about it. and the last one, the ocean. the book describes the ocean as her, and she seems like a person... but sometimes... unhuman. it's quite interesting that a book describe something natural with personality, kiera gave the ocean her own thought... and gave the reason why people drown. the plot is good\n",

      "this book was a joy to read. i wasn't keen on the uglies series, just didn't resonate with me. this series, however, seems to be right up my alley. this is hands down one of the best ya fiction books i've read this year. i love the attention to detail. westerfeld did a lot of research on steampunk, victorian sensibilities and culture, and the history of world war i and it shows. the switching between viewpoints is effortless and well executed, the characters are likeable. i think my only criticism is that even though i like the pictures, they make the book seem as though it is for a younger audience. maybe this is to give it wider appeal, i don't know, but it seemed juvenile to me - even though the pictures are gorgeous. these books aren't for everyone. i can't see any girls that read \" the girl in the steel corset \" reading these and loving them. they have a militaristic viewpoint that i think most who read ya fiction couldn't get around. for someone like me, who can appreciate fantastic writing, they are a perfect summer read. can't wait to plow my way through the next one!\n",

      "copy provided courtesy of netgalley this romance, which i believe is going to kick off a series, introduces a twist that almost doesn't come off, but i think barth pulled it together in a way that avoided chapters of humiliation and angst. ( i am not a fan of lots of angst, and humiliation is a real turn - off. ) the book opens with a bang, griffin and his close high school friends traveling to europe for a soccer tournament. a crash in the middle of nowhere nearly kills them, and griffin feels that it's on him to pull them together to save them... segue to him ten years later as a coast guard chopper pilot, determinedly focused, at all costs, on saving a family caught on the water in a hurricane. the media lauds him as a hero, griff just thinks he did his job, and his commanding officer in washington d. c. ( a terrific setting for a romance ) is giving him the stink - eye because of that \" at any cost \" aspect. griffin is a hero to the world, but his career is on the line. then griff meets chloe, who sits in a certain coffee shop every day. she's a professional letter writer. she lives a carefully safe, ordered life, measured out between frequent calls to her psychologically needy mom. we slowly begin to find out what makes chloe tick as she meets griff and sparks fly. barth tackles a tough sell in the romance world, insta - love, and then works in a total twist ( view spoiler ) [ choe is a virgin, and that utterly throws griffin for a loop, as he does not want the emotional responsibility implied ( hide spoiler ) ] that i thought barth handled well for two reasons : one, the psychological baggage both griffin and chloe carry convinced me in both their cases, but also, and this is important to my particular taste in romance, with a scrappy, sassy, genuinely funny narrative voice. i loved the characters'friends, i loved their jobs, i loved finding out why chloe became a letter writer. when the two finally get it together, their scene was a great payoff because they had learned not just to become friends, but both had learned a great deal about trust. romances promise a happily ever after, so the ending is not going to be a surprise. what makes my favorite romances work are the twists and turns in getting there, and barth hit it just right for me.\n",

      "a good friend has been telling me to read melina marchetta's jellicoe road pretty much all year. i don't know why i waited so long. this was my favorite book this month, and maybe one of my favorite books ever. like everyone warned me, the beginning was difficult and confusing and i spent the first 100 pages wondering why anyone would possibly love this book. but i powered through and was rewarded ten times over. this is a brilliant mystery, tightly woven, immaculately plotted. we get not just taylor's story, but another story too, a tragic one that unfolded years before her time. both stories are tied up in the jellicoe road, the school, and the territory wars that are played between children at the school, the locals in town, and the cadets who visit during the summers. i can't do this book justice. i just can't. all i can say is i ended up falling in love with taylor, swooning over jonah, marveling at marchetta's ingenuity and plotting, and absolutely bawling my eyes out by the end. i'll have to re - read this sometime soon. now that i know the end, i want to see all the pieces come together with more clarity. there's a reason this won the printz, people. if you haven't read it, don't be like me and wait twelve months to pick it up even though someone was swearing by it. go get a copy now. it is phenomenal and you won't regret it.\n",

      "there are so many reasons why i enjoyed this book. it's a fantastic beginning, strong and stable ground to work on and enough wit to leave you with whiplash. what makes this series so different? maybe it's the beautiful narration, the extensive descriptions that shape settings perfectly without boring you at all. the characters are real but so obviously unreal. they have distinguishable personalities that cause all sorts of emotions. i'm enthralled with the shadowhunter world, this magic, these magical places hiding in the depths of the most popular city on earth. you won't be disappointed i assure you.\n",

      "as the fourth novel in megan erickson's in focus series, overexposed delivers on everything this series is about - finding and accepting yourself, trust and learning. in overexposed we are given the vibrant character of levi whom we first met in out of frame. as an ex - cast member of trip league levi is out in the world trying to make his way after his sister unexpectedly passes away during a routine deployment overseas. trying to come to terms with his grief, and if he's honest with himself, a little bit of resentment, levi decides to hike the appalachian trail, something he was supposed to do with his sister when she got home from overseas. along the way he crosses paths with thad, a quiet but intense stranger with whom he develops a quick and strong connection with. the connection between levi and thad is so much more than a sexual one. they come to love each other through heartache and understanding. they help each other to heal, to come to terms with some ugly truths. they probably have one of the best relationships i've ever read. they chose to work together and be in such a close environment that it felt natural for them to get so close, so fast. it's been quite some time since i've read the book until writing this review, but they have stayed on my mind a lot. they are just that special to me. megan, in my opinion, has always had a great way of introducing new points of view into her stories without making it feel forced upon the reader. especially when it comes to this series. in trust the focus it was more about being true to yourself, while focus on me dealt with mental illness. overexposed brought forth new ways to look at sexual orientation and connecting with someone else. overexposed is not for the faint of heart, but nothing about this series really is. megan tackles hard topics in each of the books but in a way that shows she cares and doesn't take anything she writes lightly. levi and thad were definitely in good hands, and it shows. i cannot ever stop recommending this series, it's just that good and powerful.\n",

      "so i don't fully understand this whole thing but i've seen a lot of people doing this and from what i gather you're supposed to talk about your year in reading. now, while i am not finished my reading for 2016, i don't envision myself reading another 12 books in the year so i think i am safe to talk about things. overall, i think my reading year was pretty good. i read 123 books ( so far ) which is great. but i notice that i read barely anything in the last few months and that disappoints me a lot. i used to read more and really want to start reading more than i have lately. so i want my 2017 reading year to go so so much better than this year did but i still think overall i did well. so i will now list the worst, and best, books i read this year. favourites of 2016 ( in the order i read them this year ) : - the entire death note series by tsugumi ohba. - me before you by jojo moyes - a little life by hanya yanagihara which is now my favourite book of all time - midwinterblood by marcus sedgwick - daughter of smoke and bone by laini taylor - a mother's reckoning by sue klebold - you know me well by david levithan - the foxhole court trilogy by nora sakavic - the summer that melted everything by tiffany mcdaniel - nevernight by jay kristoff - the girl with the dragon tattoo series by stieg larsson ( except i am excluding book 3 since i wasn't a huge fan ) and the books i dnf'd this year ( also in the order i read them ) - evermore by alyson noel - the storyteller by jodi picoult - the magicians by lev grossman - the story of a new name by elena ferrante - alice in wonderland by lewis caroll - it's kind of a funny story by ned vizzini - sickened by julie gregory - john dies at the end by david wong - kafka on the shore by haruki murakami and lastly my biggest disappointment that i read in 2016 was it by stephen king.\n",

      "if you're looking for something different in na, then pick up the next book in lisa desrochers'second novel in her a little too far series. this novel is filled with some very difficult and painful life experiences for alessandro ( a young man who was close to becoming a priest, but decided against it in a little too far ) and hilary, a woman who has spent most of her young adult life numbing herself from the horrible experiences she had during her childhood. sex with her live - in pseudo boyfriend is one of those things she uses to keep a wall around herself. it's not love ; it's purely physical, and that's how she wants to keep it. but then alessandro enters hilary's life, reigniting the pain hilary's tried so hard to keep buried in her past. his presence also starts to knock down her defenses. there are many twists and turns that will surprise readers. given all that alessandro and hilary have gone through, readers will be sympathetic and root for these two to find some peace and happiness. it's not easy. their future will be shaky, because no matter what, they'll still have the past creep up on them. hopefully, together they can get through it. painful. powerful. memorable. i look forward to reading the next book in the series.\n",

      "jumping on the bandwagon and decided to do one of these things. 2016 certainly brought a lot of changes, both good and bad. but i'll just focus on the good parts of this year. it's been a great reading year, i even tried my first fantasy series and really enjoyed it! i found a lot of new authors this year, too, and enjoyed most of them. it was fun to step out of my comfort zone and try new things. there are always good and not so good books but i think 2016 actually had way more great books than past years. i will definitely be trying even more new things next year and hope it will as great as this year was. favorite 2016 reads : in non - reading related news... this year i also got to meet a dear goodreads friend of mine in ireland! yes, you read that right. ireland! this chick traveled all the way to a different country and actually survived. also got tons of books and go to meet some amazing authors at the claddagh author event. went to some kick ass concerts and i think even beat my own record with 17 concerts in one year. saw a few bands more than once, but what do you expect from a groupie? also got to meet some talented musicians too! overall 2016 was a crazy year in all aspects of my life but i actually wouldn't trade it for another year. when i weigh the amount of good things that happened to the amount of bad, the good definitely takes over. i hope all my other goodreads friends had a good year too! happy holidays and have a great new years! reviews for my favorite reads : tyrant hunt the dawn charged society girls : waverly pull me close torn kill me whispers and the roars\n",

      "short summary : badass nuns being badass. short reaction : wow! long version : mark lawrence opens the first book of a new series in a bleak, cold world that, under a dying sun, is livable only in a fifty mile wide swathe. the rest is howling wind and ice. life is just as bleak. lawrence's work often jumps back and forth in time, and this book is no different : we begin with a frame, a sister alone, facing an army. then we switch to two little girls, one summarily hanged, the other saved in the nick of time, which lets you know the stakes right up front. nona is taken off to a nunnery to begin a new life. how she got there becomes an important thread through the entire story. this first book follows nona's initial years among the girls ; in this future world, with a'moon'whose orbit is degrading above peoples who have evolved into several races with different magical traits, human nature is set in survival mode. even the one princess we glimpse is not only lethal, but a cold long - planner. in this world, the difference between nuns ( in our history's various traditions, from buddhism to roman catholicism, nuns lead a reclusive life dedicated to prayer and religious observation ) and sisterhoods ( sisters, which can be a term used by nuns, are dedicated to service in the community in some wise or other ) has merged : these nuns are being trained to fight and kill. i had to think for a couple of days about why i resist calling this book grimdark, though it is extremely violent. many of the grimdark books i've tried and set aside feature not only a crapsack world i don't want to live in through imagination, but characters i don't care about, whose petty lives are meaningless and dark, the narrative tone dismissing or outright scorning loyalty and justice, faith and mercy. any fiction that makes me feel the same way i do after watching the news is not going to hold my interest long. lawrence managed to make me care deeply about nona, hessa ( her disabled friend to whom she is psychically tied ), markus ( seen briefly, but so memorable ), the mercurial, mercutio - like clera, ara the heroic, and so on. he imparts complexity and subtlety to the nuns in charge of the girls, and creates some villains you really, really want to see get\n",

      "prisoner of night and fog is a hard one to review, not because it's confusing or annoyed me but because it is simply remarkable. and i'm pretty speechless. there's no doubt that it's well researched, and i'm not going to pretend that i know much about germany or that time than probably most of us. so it was an eye - opener and such an breath - taking way to learn. i think the only other one i've read in the boy in the striped pyjamas, which in its own context is completely different. prisoner of night and fog is set at the beginning of the rise of hitler and the national socialism in germany, and you really get an insight into his head - and the beginning of diagnosis into psychology and mental health in general. we're basically at the beginning - and in the middle of hitler's plan. hitler's a psychopath, a sociopath, and what you get to see is, compared against a different character, hitler is a lot more than that. he's also a lot more devious and calculated and careful than you thought he was. after all, to do what he did, to have that much control you'd have to be. and that's what it is about. control. nothing is more enjoyable than educating a young thing - - a girl of eighteen or twenty, as pliable as wax. - - adolf hitler mixing historical figures and fictitious characters are always interesting, and the hardest thing to do, i think. to make it look and feel real, that those fictitious characters belong there. it's always fun to see how it's handled. and while the story is central around hitler, prisoner of night and fog is about the fall and rise of gretchen muller. in that order. her belief system, although twisted by uncle dolf, she is undoubtfully loyal. she's not easily swayed. but, she also hates violence, and when confronted with that her choice is simple, while it's not simple at all because of what she's been told against what she feels and what she slowly learns all lead to the same thing : conflict. can i just say how amazing this was done? it's not a quick switch. gretchen doesn't just wake up one day and thinks differently. it's gradual and timely, and even then until the last possible moment she claws to keep that belief, to everything she's known. the best thing about\n",

      "this book was powerful. the words, the emotions, the story. i'm not bothering to give it a star rating as that seems trite. i had shivers at the end. review coming : this was the first book that i've ever read by deb caletti so i had absolutely no expectations going in, which ended up being perfect as stay was a great all - around read. i can't say that i loved this book due to the topics it raised as that would seem callous, but it is something that i think people should read. books with content like this are incredibly important and if anyone knows any others that they thought were well done i wouldn't mind if you left a note. stay alternates from chapter to chapter going back and forth between clara's experience with christian and the present day, the timing of which is less than a year apart so it isn't at all jarring. clara meets christian at a basketball game and when their eyes met it was instant attraction. here's a quote from the beginning that i adored : \" he had this accent. it was lush and curled, with the kind of lilt and richness that made you instantly think of distant cities and faraway lands - the kind of city you'd see in a foreign film, with a snow - banked river winding through its center, stone bridges crossing to an ornate church... the other guys in that gym - they watched espn and slunked in suburban living rooms and slammed the doors of their mothers'minivans. see - i had already made him into someone he would never be, and i didn't know it then, but he was doing the same with me, too. \" - stay ( 4 ) this perfectly exemplifies the way they met, immediate and hot, as well as caletti's writing style. she has a way with choosing just the right phrases and even words that not only fit the book overall but specifically fit the individual character which really helps you imagine everything in your head as it happens. one of the best parts of all of the descriptions are clara's footnotes that relate people and events as she knows them to the reader that helps everything flow that much more smoothly. some of them are purely factual, some are amusing, but all of them are told from her pov. we also see clara point out a lot of things about other people that we alone reading may not have seen, but now that she's told us\n",

      "another year comes to a close. 2016 is probably going to be one of those years that stays around in history books, where the number symbolizes an era or a rapid transition, even though what happened is the culmination of years of broader trends, too vast and impersonal to totally understand even through the perspective of our own lives. i once attempted to read history to gain an objective understanding of the past. but this has changed a great extent. the past is not set. it, too, changes, depending on continuing events, or just by reading a few paragraphs of a book. certain ideas or interpretations of events reconfigure the past or the structure of the past within my understanding. books also form a sort of network for me. i'm not really making the effort to look for books as much as i used to, but i dig through citations or references or other people's anthologies, or whatever else i find in here. just the other day, i was asked for a set of book recommendations, but i found that difficult because i had no idea where to begin with the other person's experiences and what set of ideas they worked with. so. this year in books. not organized by month, more by categories. persons, lives charlemagne american ulysses : a life of ulysses s. grant bush frederick the great : king of prussia augustine : conversions to confessions musui's story : the autobiography of a tokugawa samurai incarnations : india in 50 lives bobby kennedy : the making of a liberal icon autobiography of mark twain, volume 3 : the complete and authoritative edition the ongoing crises the rise and fall of american growth : the u. s. standard of living since the civil war evicted : poverty and profit in the american city strangers in their own land : anger and mourning on the american right dark money : the hidden history of the billionaires behind the rise of the radical right achieving our country : leftist thought in twentieth - century america hillbilly elegy : a memoir of a family and culture in crisis white trash : the 400 - year untold history of class in america glengarry glen ross dreamland : the true tale of america's opiate epidemic notes of a native son the slave's cause : a history of abolition politics and philosophy : and the twain shall never meet on tyranny the shipwrecked mind : on political reaction the reckless mind : intellectuals in politics philosophy and real politics russia : beyond history secondhand time : the last of the soviets the invention\n",

      "i have to admit one thing. i kinda start every book by ll just because she is an amazing serie - writer. i want to see how her characters are doing, i want to remember their love stories. even more than reading about the hero and heroine of any current book that i read. this was exactly the case. i started because i love the series and i was more than caught by the first book ( remember cole and pope? i loved that story ). and i liked this as well. it was sweet, though heavier than other books in the serie ( see how i can't stop comparing? ). i always had a tiny crush on lincoln ( not a surprise, right? ) and seeing the real him... it was strong. so strong, that daisy was blown away. i didn't see her in the same \" spotlight \" as lincoln. she felt more like side - character, to be fair. and the end? totally unnecessary.

      "i am so torn over this book i can't even see straight. this is the first book i have read that makes me have such a strong love - hate relationship with it. complete mental sentence structure but i cant think straight. i feel like i need to write a review for this before i oscillate again.. and then again.. and then i keep going circles. firstly, i think the author is one clever cookie. an author cannot just simply make all the other characters so wonderful and then make us suffer by living inside the mc's head. the point was to make us realise her mistakes ( right along with her ) and other completely inane and idiotic stuff that miss mia does. because we do them too. ( i acknowledge it very grudgingly, fyi ) will. oh will so beautifully written. and the others too, such great secondary characters. forever neurotic and eclectic. ( i feel like drawing hearts around his name right now, thats how i feel about him ) there is always something there in the artistic - y, struggler - y types. they come straight from somewhere else, and very few are found to be themselves after life has worn them out. but the author has to drive her point home by bringing in one little topic that is the theme nowadays : jealousy i don't care if it did or din't drive the characters crazy but it certainly made me want to pull my hair out. the music. it was so brilliant, and beautiful and so cleverly placing little lyrics and incidents. other things that i really loved : kell's ( i cant remember the original name but it was awesome ), jackson, the apartment and the frames, the writing, the whole crew, nyc, blues, notes, small weddings, pops, flights ( haha ), one - line cryptic sayings, central perk ( oops park ), huge families, and so many other things that i am forgetting but i don't want to. but one thing i will never forget is the prologue. brilliaaaant. effing brilliant. i really really really hate this book, but i really really really love it too. \" i felt a sense of peace and satisfaction. i was finally able to own the mistakes i made. \"\n",

      "what isn't to love about a book that can make you laugh in the face of tragedy, rip at your heart, and help you get your feet onto solid ground after a quake has hit? that's what it's like reading the beginning of everything by robyn schneider. narrated by ezra, a senior boy who goes from being his hs's golden boy to the object of school pity after a car crash left him permanently debilitated. in the aftermath, he attempts to move on with his life by reconnecting with an old friend toby and falling in love with cassidy, a girl with her own darkness hovering over her. things i loved about this novel : 1. that ezra begins to see the shallowness of his old friends - especially his ex - girlfriend. 2. ezra embraces new experiences. 3. he takes his time to make adjustments in his life. 4. he is accepting of cassidy and all her weird quirks. 5. he realizes his mistakes on how he treated his best friend toby after a bizarre roller coaster accident made toby and outcast at age twelve. 6. the ending shows a great deal of progress and growth for ezra, which i admire tremendously. this is an emotional story with a powerful twist and many insights on popularity, friendship, relationships, and coping with loss. definitely recommend.\n",

      "a beautiful, slow paced, but interesting, and angst free story of finding love in a new place welcome to glamour! meet dean, a night stalker, who comes to the rescue of his orphaned niece, and anthony, a guidance councillor, with a lovely italian family. - - dean is the most one - syllable speaking guy i've ever met. he is so awkward around people, it's funny. coming to glamour because his sister died and he has to work something out for his niece nicky, he can't wait to get back to afghanistan with the night stalkers. but it appears, he isn't the tough unemotional guy one might consider him. not wanting nicky to grow up in foster care, as he himself and his sister had to, he takes up the responsibility of taking care of her. all with the help of anthony, nicky's guidance counsellor. while dean doesn't talk a lot, anthony can't seem to stop. but he is in no way annoying, he's just a lovely guy. coming out of a bad break - up, he isn't ready to get his heart broken again, and is wary of getting involved. dean and anthony share a mutual attraction and find themselves taking care of each other. they were just what the other needed. they complemented each other, had fun together, and it was great to see their relationship grow. the sex was passionate and hot. i liked that the scenes were diversified and that there were no defined roles in their love life. there are several secondary characters, who supplement the story. furthermost, there is nicky, a teenage girl who just lost her mom, but is happy to let dean into her life, after some first hesitancy. i think she was well portrayed and seemed very realistic and believable. anthony's family was very supporting in this whole affair. it was lovely how they were there for each other, and dean and nicky. - - this book is written in an alternating third person pov, which was really well done. it's always clear which perspective is shown, and we get dean's and anthony's view of the events. this books is very slow paced without being boring in the slightest. you just want to know what is going on and what's gonna happen next. the author takes her time to introduce the characters. she also makes the growing relationships and feelings seem very realistic, because she doesn't rush into things. i really loved that\n",

      "nowadays, i tend to look at ya fiction through the slightly hysterical lens of what is this telling my goddaughter? i like what this book is telling my goddaughter. it's telling her that she's powerful and strong, that she lives in a world as much inhabited by women as men, and that she can do whatever she damn well wants. that love and compassion and courage have nothing to do with gender. it's also telling her she deserves to be loved for exactly who she is. he laughed \" you may hunt for my food and protect me when we're attacked, if you like. i'll thank you for it. \" \" but i'd never need to protect you, if we were attacked. and i doubt you need me to do your hunting, either. \" \" true. but you're better than i am, katsa. and it doesn't humiliate me. \" he fed a branch to the fire. \" it humbles me. but it doesn't humiliate me. \" so, we have a brash, bold, emotionally distant heroine and a gentle, more emotionally secure hero. we also have a world bristling with amazing characters, lots of them women, some of them gay. it's a bit rough round the edges in places. the naming conventions are kind of silly. the writing is functional rather than stunning. and for people who like their fantasy world building done with a trowel, it'll probably seem a flimsy and lacklustre. but i love this. and i look forward to sharing it with kathryn when she's a teeny bit older.\n",

      "terrific final book. with the exception of one thread, i loved the characters, the pacing, the moods, the sense of history. the action and imagination. the moments of the numinous. and of course the humor. the twists and turns had me guessing ; in a couple situations i was right, but i was caught by surprise far more times. the climax had me glued to the pages, and the ending, oh, it caught me right by the heart. everyone deserving came to excellent places. i was especially satisfied with arista and hadrian's final denouement. the one bit i had trouble with was gwen's arc. ( view spoiler ) [ when she first came on the scene, i hoped she wouldn't turn out to be the prostitute with the heart of gold who has to die tragically in the end, as i've seen in too many books. i thought we were safe from that until the last half of the previous book. when she got really weepy, i knew she was wearing a red shirt. and it didn't help that for reasons that made no sense, she kept their daughter secret after agreeing to marry royce. i should have thought if she was willing to marry him, and even pick names for their future children, she would walk off with him and say, \" i have a wonderful surprise for you. \" keeping so isolated a man from knowing his kid in those precious early years hit this parent like a crime. nor could i believe that gwen would, after they agreed to marry, send royce off to rescue the one he loved most - - she really didn't see it was her, after all their tender scenes together? i kept thinking, when characters are professing love and trust and being willfully stupid, it's red shirt ahoy. the surprise twist with the wily old university master didn't quite jive either. modina's beautiful line to mercy that of course mothers and daughters will always find one another almost redeemed that plot thread, but not quite. and the bit at the end, saving royce's life by the sudden revelation of mercy rang false, though everything around that scene was so wonderfully effective. i expected him to feel betrayed that gwen had unaccountably hidden his daughter from him for six years, especially given they were planning to marry. i expected him to be devastated at the implied lack of trust. i'm glad he didn't react that way, but i\n",

      "cover : clever - i like the overlay of the devilish outline and fangs with the title in the middle. red on black = perfect. i really, really like this. a demon ( mr. gabriel ) gets the job of a school librarian, ends up sucking the essence out of students, and gets girls to swoon, especially annie, cyn's best friend. cyn, the mc, is immune to the demon's powers and she's determined to stop him, whatever the cost. things that i liked about this novel : 1. cyn's crush on ryan, the boy she ends up fighting demons with. 2. cyn's loyalty as a friend. she would walk to the ends of the earth ( or to a hellish place where demons dwell ) for her best friend. i love how she doesn't give up on annie, even when annie is under a spell. 3. the invasion of demons into the school and their murderous ways. strangely, i was totally into the murder of teachers etc. that's what's great about a fiction. it's make - believe! 4. the development of ryan and cyn's relationship. it wasn't insta - love. even though cyn has crushed on him for a long time, they don't get together too quickly. i like how they talk with one another, learn about each other. ( and sharing banana bread! ) 5. the inclusion of the play sweeney todd. cyn is in charge of props / stage crew and ryan plays lead. love that the demons are into the play and can't wait to see the production. 6. the description of the store books of darkness : your one - stop shop for magic, mystery, hidden secrets of the universe. i could completely visualize the place. 7. cyn is a strong female character, and i loved that she stood her ground, wasn't swayed to change her mind once she decided what she felt was right. 8. the tackle!!!! swoon. ( you have to read it to understand! ) i really believe that young adults will enjoy this one very much! even though the cover says 14 and up, i wouldn't have a problem giving this to a seventh grader to read. and yes! libraries should absolutely carry this book!\n",

      "i've always been drawn to books that include music, bands, and the fame and success associated with them. girls in the moon captures the moments before and after the fame which is one of many superb aspects in this book. i knew prior to reading this book that janet mcnally is a poet and her talent effortlessly shines through in this novel. the words were laced with metaphors and flowed so beautifully. basically every line in this book is quotable. reading this book is like luxuriously savoring a cupcake. slowly unwrap the foil of janet's words and reach the delicious and complex meaning behind them. the complex characters and their tangled relationships were fascinating to follow. janet did a great job portraying an authentic sister relationship between phoebe and luna. she also takes us back to phoebe and luna's mother's youth as we see her deal with the rising fame of her own band and the changes it has caused in her life. girls in the moon is really about growing up and trying to discover who you are. phoebe spends so much time searching for answers and details on her parents'lives as rockstars thinking it will help her sort through her own life. i love the character development that she undergoes. it wasn't too drastic and thus felt more realistic. although this book progressed at a steady pace, there weren't really many moments of huge shock or turmoil. i feel like we spent the book meandering through past memories and present happenings, yet this book still struck me in a way. the themes felt so real and so easy to soak up for ourselves. this book makes me want to go out and do every single thing i've been too scared to try before. it makes me want to doubt myself less and take chances. overall girls in the moon is such a hard book to review. it completely charmed me, and i urge you to pre - order this book!\n",

      "vortex opens where tempest left off, but i can only compare vortex to whatever your county fair's wildest, most unpredictable ride is. ( mine, for reference, was called the himalaya, and it was equal parts fun and terrifying. ) vortex is not a slow novel, and it is not a mild novel. vortex is one twist and turn after another, thrilling emotional highs and devastating lows that brought real tears to my eyes. once again we follow jackson as he ventures deeper into the world of tempest, the cia branch that exists to fight eots ( enemies of time, ) or rogue time travelers. julie cross weaves this second installment right into your heart with growth from jackson, and other characters like his dad, kevin, and cia agent jenni stewart. i was tense reading vortex. i was broken reading vortex, because i kept sinking right into jackson's story so effortlessly. both old and new characters immediately felt like real people, for the duration of vortex. and something that was as genius as it was frustrating is how time travel and notions of parallel universes come into play to show us familiar characters in ways and places we - and i - never expected to find them. scenes i never thought i'd see but hoped for are in vortex, which conspired to leave me shaken or hopeful. plot - wise, cross steps everything up a few notches, in terms of mysteries, secrets, and danger. there were several moments where i found myself re - reading paragraphs to make sure i'd read them right. and more than once, i literally had to pause in my reading to wrap my head around an explanation, or an answer that only raised more questions. vortex is brilliantly crafted, with a pace that is never boring. the heart of vortex is jackson. if jackson wasn't as compelling a character, as real a character as he is, these books wouldn't be quite as amazing. they'd be a good science fiction story with an awesome plot, but jackson and his love for holly makes tempest and vortex soar to the top of my mental \" favorite books \" list. jackson reads like a real guy, with faults and good qualities that make you want to hug him, then give him a good shake. i felt so lost when he did, so happy when he did, so confused when he did. jackson is an amazing conduit to carry emotions right to the reader, emotions i was still reeling from a few hours after finishing vortex. i have rarely\n",

( literally, mindee arnett probably thought i was stalking netgalley, because i tweeted her as soon as i saw her book up there. ) i just finished the nightmare affair, and i think i'm a bit in love with mindee's characters, because they're all memorable. dusty was the perfect narrator - sassy, fierce, yet vulnerable at the same time. i felt a kinship with her throughout the nightmare affair, and am already looking forward to revisiting the world of arkwell academy and the various magickind who attend. the nightmare affair was one of those books that i'd put down to go do something ( chores, yuck ), and then find myself eager to get back to it. i read the first 100 pages feverishly, then found a slower pace for the rest of this awesome debut novel. there are elements of various fantasy tropes and trends here, but mindee gives it all her own fresh spin, choosing to focus on both what we know, and what we don't. she takes myths and fantasy creatures we know about, and gives them a life of their own, outside of the pages of our well - worn childhood storybooks. i. loved. it. the world - building was fantastic, literally a world within our world, magickind co - existing with \" ordinaries \" at times while the rest of the world is blissfully unaware. add fabulous characters to the spot - on world building and pacing, and i was a goner soon after i started the nightmare affair. i've already talked a little bit about how cool dusty is, but there were several other characters - friends, teachers, even one or two \" like \" interests who flesh\n",

      "well, i'm glad that's over with. have you ever read a synopsis for a book, thought how amazing it sounded, and just knew you were going to love the story? that's what happened to me here. i love all things witches and horror, so i couldn't wait to read this story. then i read it. again, i'm glad that's over with. our two main characters are nicholas and silla ( short for drusilla ) and this story is told through both of their perspective, which is always appreciated, because i enjoy seeing things from all sides. silla's parents died a few months before this story takes place and she's living with her sort - of grandmother judy and older brother reese, who always made me hungry for some peanut butter cups. her parents are buried in a cemetery near her house where she goes to perform blood magic from a spell book someone referred to as the deacon left on her doorstep. the spell book was actually robert's, her father, so she decides to believe in its power since he believed in it. at first, reese thinks the whole thing is ridiculous, but she convinces him to start practicing blood magic with her. as they dive deeper into the spells and become more powerful, the quest is not just to experiment with magic anymore, but to use the magic to find out how exactly their parents were killed. how does nick have a connection with all of this? well, he spies on her as she tries her first blood magic spell and she catches him. of course, he knows more about blood magic than silla thinks. he, too, lives near the cemetery. his mother did some... things, and she is gone, so he lives with his father and stepmother lilith. through the blood magic, he has this connection with silla so he helps her, reese, and myself try to figure out what the hell is going on. it's kind of hard to piece together a coherent thought about this book, because there is just so much going on, and i'm still somewhat confused. there are journal entries all throughout the book that don't really provide a lot of informative information, but they are key to the big revelation. the entries are written from the early 1900s scattered around to the late 1900s by a woman named josephine darly. she writes of a doctor named philip osborn who teaches her everything there is to know about blood magic. they are informative, yet kind of disturbing\n",

      "i've read five books by rachel cohn, and beta is by far my favorite. cohn wove an interesting futuristic tale filled with sci - fi, danger, and murder. the scientific aspects reminded me a little of mary pearson's the jenna fox chronicles series, which i absolutely loved. so, if you're a fan of pearson's books, you will definitely like beta. elysia is a teen clone - - a prototype or beta - - created to serve the elite class on the island of demesne. she is purchased by mrs. bratton and is basically enslaved to serve as a companion to everyone in the bratton household, including the eighteen - year - old son ivan, a drug - addicted jerk. with her strength and speed, elysia helps train him for his upcoming military service. at first, the relationship works well, but soon he becomes more and move possessive. it's fun to read about all of elysia's talents, which include swimming and diving to olympic standards. about midway through this novel, the pace really picks up and becomes quite intense. the reader will be surprised over and over and over again. and what an ending! truly a cliffhanger. one of the strengths of this novel is the cultural diversity. it also brings to the forefront class distinctions, which are definitely prevalent today. if sci - fi, futuristic novels are your thing, then you will love beta. personally, i look forward to reading the next novel in this series. i received an arc of beta from the bea.\n",

      "\" i am a duke yet. and not just any duke, but the duke of montgomery, and my inheritance is death and mayhem. \" it's been several years since i've read a new historical romance novel and this decadently delightful read has reminded me why i was obsessed with this genre for close to a decade. nothing sweeps me away quite like a love story set against a backdrop often associated with fairytales : the clothes, the carriages, the language, the society and the sex... i could go on and one. plus, throw in a handsome duke, and i am instantly interested. duke of sin isn't quite the quintessential bodice ripper for there's a sliver of darkness, featuring an unconventional historical hero and the woman who brings him to heel ( sort of ). a friend recommended this book, as well as the others in this series. she raved about it and its author, proclaiming her love for the writing and all the love stories leading up to this one, book 10. well, i was intrigued by this book's synopsis, and didn't have time to read 9 books before this one, so i shrugged, dove in, and hoped for the best. \" this is who i am, seraphine. naked, with blade and blood. i am vengeance. i am hate. i am sin personified. never mistake me for the hero of this tale, for i am not and shall never be. i am the villain. \" this book is fantastic! i absolutely loved experiencing this and falling back into this world again. it was just what i needed - - i've been beyond stressed these past few days - - and i was, honestly, completely riveted. elizabeth hoyt's writing is just the kind i love : smooth, expressive without being ridiculous, smart, and humorous. her characters, especially val, are a joy to read. he's an anti - hero that's so arrogant it's galling, he's morally ambiguous, but oh - so lovable, he's infuriating, exasperating, and totally addicting. i would forgive him of all his sins. bridget is a fantastic counter point for the vibrant val ; she's a heroine with steel, something that isn't always typical in this genre. the plot is engaging, quick - paced with a bit of intrigue that i didn't expect. the romance is sexy and juicy -\n",

      "see more of my reviews at once upon a prologue partials is a unique book, and one that, despite feeling that it is sometimes fuzzy on details i would like more clarification on, for the most part, author dan wells draws the reader immediately into his book. partials catapults the reader smack - dab in the middle of the action, where we learn instantly the effects rm - the mysterious virus unleashed by the partials eleven years ago - has on infants : they never live long. the youngest human left in the decimated population is fourteen years old, and with no surviving children to carry the next generation forward, conditions are strained. the hope act mandates pregnancy at 18 years old, and kira walker feels hopeless, in the midst of it all. i liked and felt for kira immediately. she is strong and opinionated, with a huge heart, and she is not happy with her lot in life, or with her government's attempts at an answer to all the problems. kira wants to do something other than watch new babies die, and i definitely sympathized with her. being in that situation - and worse, working in the maternity ward - is bad enough, worse is knowing there's nothing you can do - or is there? what i liked most about partials were the characters. all of them were strong, yet with their own flaws, so that they all seemed real, like people you might get to know. kira wasn't happy being a bystander - she wanted to reach out and fix something, anything. her adoptive sisters each had their own reasons for being unhappy, for wanting to do more, be more. marcus, kira's friend and sometimes boyfriend, was fiercely devoted to her, yet sometimes unable to understand her actions and motivations. several of the secondary characters are like kira in that they are determined to change their present, in order so that there is a future, while others, including some of her adopted family, are hesitant to rock the boat. the plan kira develops is risky and thrilling - i was at once supportive and afraid, as dan wells propels the reader right along on kira's journey. though several months pass in partials, the pacing is steady, and never really falters or detracts from the story being told. plot wise, partials is a very strong story, which throws several twists into the narrative so that when i read the last page, i was definitely wishing it was time for failsafe ( the\n",

      "one choice can transform you. the tagline for this book could not be truer. i flew through this book. it sunk its claws into me and kept me reading late into the night. tris'dystopian world is well defined and unfolds fluidly. as a reader, you have no trouble understanding the magnitude of the choice she faces and feeling a sense of dread as her initiation progresses. the novel has its fair share of fighting and violence and if the hunger games made you squeamish, this read likely will too. but to balance out the blood, strong friendships are formed and tested, and an unexpected ( and surprisingly charming ) romance springs up partway through the book. it is certainly not the primary plot point of tris'tale, but you'll find yourself rooting for her nonetheless. i think the most interesting thing about this book though, is the idea of a single choice transforming who you are. can you truly commit yourself to one virtue and one alone for the rest of your life? is it even possible to be just one thing? people are often shades of gray, and yet in tris'world, citizens are expected to make a single choice and put that choice above all else, even their families. faction before blood. it is a painful idea, one that tris struggles with over the course of her initiation, and one that readers too will question alongside her. originally reviewed here\n",

      "after a ( self - rated ) dismal reading year in 2015 ( but a great life year! ), 2016 turned out to be a pretty good reading year ( let's not talk about the life part ). i read the most books in a year probably since college. this was in part due to being jobless for a couple months in the beginning of the year ; but even after starting a new job, i kept reading on average a book a week. it was also probably because i read a lot more fiction this year than i have in recent years - i generally get through fiction a lot faster than non - fiction. if i had to pick any themes this year, the biggest that stands out is zombies. i read a lot about zombie this year : almost a quarter of 2016's books! a lot of them were okay or terrible ( i really need to pick my self - published books more carefully ). the second theme in terms of most - read is scifi. i still haven't read a lot of classics ( dune, ugh, need to get on that this year ), but i read a lot of newer stuff this year. ramez naam's nexus series was interesting, but i really enjoyed aurora by kim stanley robinson and sleeping giants by sylvain neuvel ( can't wait for the sequel ). and the final theme, not based on books read but self - selected, is birds. i started working at the national audubon society in the spring and let me tell you, i know way more about birds than ever before! while a lot of learning was through magazines, articles, and online venues, a couple books snuck in as well. i'm sure that the birds category will be even larger in 2017 but the 5 books i finished in 2016 were a great start. my top three were : - birdology by one of my favorite authors, sy montgomery ( which i read before the job was even a glimmer in my eye! ). a nice collection of essays about different kinds of birds. the chicken and hummingbird chapters were so good! - the living bird by gerrit vyn. an incredible photography book focused mostly on north american birds, with some great essays on birds and the natural world. - holy moli by hob osterlund. a short, quick read that focuses on laysan albatross in hawaii but it's also a memoir mixed in. i absolutely love albatross and this book grew on\n",

      "this book caught my eyes because it seemed mckinley's first attempt to break away from endless rewrites of beauty and the beast. it is a first - person narrative by jake mendoza, who lives at the makepeace institute of integrated dragon studies in smokehill national park. smokehill is the millions - of - acres preserve for about two hundred of the few remaining draco australiensis, which are on the endangered list. the story begins when jake is fourteen, and at first the reader might assume that he's writing of very recent events. jake reminds the reader repeatedly that the idea of a preserve for dragons is a fairly tense controversy. some, including in the government, insist that dragons are dangerous, expensive, and should be wiped out. environmentalists, scientists, and dragon - lovers remind everyone that there are no records of them eating humans, even though they're a hundred feet long, fly, and breathe fire. but then a man is killed in the dragon preserve. on his first overnight solo hike, jake finds a dragon dying next to the human she killed. jake realizes this news could destroy smokehill - - even though the dead man is surrounded by an arsenal of weaponry, making it clear even to jake that he was a sport hunter who had attacked the dragon first. the fact that he was there illegally, for no good purpose, is forgotten in the resulting media feeding frenzy as the man turns out to have come from a rich, influential family - - rich enough to support the habit of seeking ever more exotic creatures to hunt and kill just for sport. so jake and the others at smokehill have to keep the secret of the first - ever - seen baby dragon. this is a tremendous challenge for jake : how can you keep secret a creature whose habits are utterly alien, yet that regards you as its mom? especially when weird things start happening inside your brain? mckinley has build an admirable career on skillfully combining the architecture of wonder with convincing realistic detail so that the reader feels she can live inside the story. most of her work is read and reread to pieces by her fans - - my own favorite is the blue sword, which i happily reread. that said, i think some readers might find dragonhaven problematic, mostly because of the narrative voice. the immediacy, the tone, the word choices, are intended to make it seem that the protagonist is a teen - - but we find out that he isn't as close to events as at first surmised by\n",

      "see below for my take on crooked kingdom. student review by : myliah wp. ( 11th grade ) crooked kingdom follows another adventure of our favorite not very good people, kaz brekker, jesper fahey, inej ghafa, wylan van eck, matthias helvar, and nina zenik. after the events of the last novel, you think that it can't get any worse for this group of bad gooders. it can. this novel will take you on a wild ride and never stop until the end. now to tell you the truth, i wasn't excited to read the second book in the series because you know how book series go. the first book six of crows is amazing, so i assumed it would all go downhill from there, but this was not the case. i was thrown into the world of ketterdam once again and i fell in love all over again. the characterization in this novel and how the characters grew despite them really not having the greatest moral code is amazing. i really enjoyed that it wasn't all focused on two characters from the novel but all of them. you learn about them in a new light, and you grow to care for them in a way that tugs at your heartstrings if anything happens to them. i also liked how the author took the time before each new twist in the plot to get the reader a little bit of breathing room. it wasn't one bombshell on top of another and another. she took her time with the story and it was paced so wonderfully that i honestly cried a little at the beauty of it. the words that originally came from ketterdam were tricky to understand, and i was glad for the glossary in the back of book explaining it all. that was really helpful throughout the book as i had to go back and make sure i had the right grisha in my mind. the artwork on the cover was very well done and what was drawn me into the story in the first place. and i'm glad it did. recommendation : anyone who likes fantasy novels and reading about a group of people that will question your moral code and your heart. grade range : 8th grade and up genre : fantasy literary merit : very good characterization : excellent my take : i enjoyed crooked kingdom but not to the same extent that i did six of crows. perhaps it was because i read the first book too long ago and forgot the characters'backstories. or it could have been that\n",

      "i confess, i've had this book - - an arc from the publisher - - for a long time. i had opened it immediately, skimmed the first few pages, and knew instantly that it was worth my full, undivided attention. so, i set it aside for a year. now i can finally report : homegoing did not disappoint. for a book with so many generations and so many characters, i was amazed at how invested i was in each person, and how each chapter brought a deeper understanding of the overall saga. i'm still processing some parts of the story, which is a good thing. homegoing sticks with you. * * * full disclosure : i met gyasi at a book event ( we were seated next to each other! ) and the fact that she is a lovely human being in no way influenced this review.\n",

      "ohh my fucking gaaaaaawd!!!! my life is now complete.. thankyou jesus / kristen ashley. i pre ordered this so i had it on my kindle on release date. i tried with all my will power to leave it as long as i could cope because i knew when i read it i'd morn the end of this series hardcore. this series was always unfinished without this story. honestly rock chick is my all time favourite series ever period. not because of who wrote it or the characters. it was actually the first series i read that i actually loved. one that showed me the wonders of reading, the power of imagination and the love of words on paper. i'd read series before this and liked them a lot, however this one showed me just how fanfuckingtastic books can be. nothing will ever compete with this series. it's like the first born child except in book form. this book killed it in every right way. i'm not going in to detail because it would honestly ruin the brilliance of it. this story's filled with heartbreak, healing, love and laughter. it's filled with dreams and hope. a lot of people may disagree with me and that's ok because i have a special attachment to this series that some don't. this book completed this series in the best possible way. it made me understand daisy in a way that wasn't possible before. i fell in love with her over and over again. i also found a new place in my heart for marcus whom flew right up the top of the best book boyfriend scale. his patience and kindness with daisy. his complete adoration for her. just him in general. this book isn't all rainbows and pink fluffy clouds raining popcorn. but for me it is absolute perfection. all the side characters are perfect. of course they are. smithy!!! that man is an angel surrounded in nipple pastie's, glitter g - strings and pleaser. the mouth of a sailer and brash as fuck but jesus take the wheel i fucking love him. i love them all. if there's ever a book world i could be transported to.. it 100 % would be this one. that ending though!!!!! i cried like a bitch. most perfect ending ever. kristen ashley you have out done yourself. thanks for sharing something so special.\n",

      "blazed through this, as i have with all the gone books so far. what i love about this series : 1. the characters. because of the size of the cast, many are on the two - dimensional side, but michael grant manages to establish them quickly, sharply, and effectively. i'm super invested in how these kids turn out. 2. choices and consequences. he doesn't shy away from them. i'm on the edge of my seat. 3. he doesn't shy away from much of anything, actually, and in a series as hardcore as this, i think that's necessary. i appreciate how he puts his characters in impossible situations and follows through almost always - - and how he's not afraid to shake things up. ( see point five. ) 4. pacing. as mentioned before, i go through these books like they're candy. addictive, addictive candy. ( and if you've read this book... um...'nuff said with regards to that particular simile. ) 5. the ending to this book. what an awesome change in the status quo. i can't wait for light. what i don't love about this series : 1. little pete is a caricature of autism and - - as someone who's actually autistic herself - - i cringe whenever he's on the page. both pete and his sister's perception of him seem to be written from an outside perspective, and given that he becomes a bigger and bigger character, he becomes more cringe - worthy as the series goes on. 2. you know how i said these books don't shy away from anything? ( view spoiler ) [ scratch that. how is it that a series can have everything from graphic torture to teen pregnancy and cannibalism, but the word'fuck'is censored? that drew me right out of the book. ( hide spoiler ) ] 3. in fact, ( view spoiler ) [ the treatment of sex has also been awful. preteens are hooked on alcohol and drugs, but the first mention of sex isn't until book four. ( and of course, it's between the two ~ evil ~ teens and immediately results in your standard demonic pregnancy. ) come on : there should've been mentions of pregnant kids long before then. astrid and sam hooking up gives us a healthier portrayal of sex, but apparently any mention of contraceptive\n",

      "i loved this book. i suspect others will hate it. it's definitely for a certain kind of reader. if you hear \" a circus run entirely at night, with a monochromatic color scheme, and magic! \" and get excited, this book is probably for you. if you're the type of person who dissects each book you read to see if the characters motivations are 100 % realistic and scrutinize every plot element, this book is not for you. the characters are delightful : enigmatic, archetypal, and distinct, but not particularly \" deep. \" the plot is fun, but not particularly sensical. the circus is the true heart of the story. it is the coolest freakin circus ever. really. morgenstein could have been three hundred pages of just description of the circus and i would have sat at her feet, wide eyed. i am usually not an \" aesthetic \" reader. clever design, beautiful details... i appreciate them, but i mostly connect with books when i find emotional resonance with the characterization. in night circus, morgenstein captured the childlike awe of the circus and then transfigured it for adults. to age it up, she didn't make it unneccesarily \" dark \" or \" gritty \" and although the book occasionally embraced an ironic tone, the circus itself inspired genuine wonder. that was enough for me. : ) on a personal geekery level, i loved the character of isobel and usage of tarot throughout the book. morgenstein is a tarot deck creator herself and her deep knowledge and love of it show in the text.\n",

      "even better than the first book, with terrific characterization, non - stop action, sharp insights trading with moments of neck - grabbing horror, and whooping laughter. i thought i'd snort up my spleen when reading jalan's duel with count isen - - that directly follows a scene of horror, that directly follows a scene of... well, let's just say that the emotional roller coaster in this book has enough twists, loops - de - loop, and jet - stream soaring plunges to keep the reader up very, very late. the story picks up in trond with the melt of the snows. jalan is his insouciant self, tuttugu has settled to a happy existence, but poor snorri has been brooding through the grip of winter, waiting so that he can renew his quest to rescue his murdered family from hell. of course jalan bitches and moans, only going when he has to, a contrast to fat old tuttugu, who drops his good life for a hopeless quest out of loyalty. along the way the indefatigable trio are joined by kara, a sorceress whose motivations are difficult to divine, but who is quite deft as fending off jal's lecherous attacks. they also pick up an orphaned shepherd boy, hennen, whose emotional maturity is about on par with jalan's. no, actually, hennen is more mature than jalan in many ways - - and watching these two develop a relationship is one of the pleasures of the book. so much poignance at unexpected places, plus the expected mayhem and grue, stitch together jalan's forcible explorations of his past, which he has succeeded in papering over, as the young will do with trauma. his grandmother comes a lot clearer in this book, as do the elder women who are playing the long game. anyone with a hankering for complicated, fascinating female characters more than a match for the guys will be pleased with this book. the fuel - injected pacing never lets up, clear to the last line, which left me gasping.\n",

      "grinch here. i have so many complicated feelings about this.... bookscriptthing. on one hand, i literally grew up with harry ( i was 11 when i read book 1, 12 for 2 and 3, 14 when book 4 came out, etc ), and i adore the world. on the other, leave harry alone and let him have his hea. on the other other hand, jkr didn't actually write this, and it's a script. on the other other other hand, i read the spoilers, and i think it sounds terrible, and just siriously leave harry alone, jkr. i feel zero excitement about this project. i think having a play be canon is problematic because it's elitist, which is so anti - harry that i want to scream. you can say \" but this is the script of the play! \" all you want, but you know that plays and musicals irl are approximately 1000 % more magical in person. even filming the play or sending it on a world tour isn't exactly the same. i think there's this thing that happens when a series ( books, tvs, movies, etc ) becomes beloved and popular, and it's that fans always want more, but eventually you have to reach a point where you need to stop, otherwise what makes fans love it will go missing. cursed child has no magic for me. harry's story has reached the point of no return for me because i was wholly satisfied by the completion of his story in deathly hallows. i guess cursed child is technically about albus, but if that were entirely true, why is it called \" harry potter and the cursed child \"? if albus were having his own adventures independent of his father's story, that's one thing. i have no desire to see a beloved friend from my adolescence be dragged down again. he overcame his conflicts already. i have to say i'm done.\n",

      "* * spoiler alert * * well, first of all, i hate \" romeo & juliet \" stories. it took me 10 years to watch west side story again after i watched it the first time. somehow, though, laini makes it so i just don't care. this story was original, amazing and beautifully written in third person! the thing about 3rd person is, you can get so much richer descriptive language. because let's face it, when you're observing something in the world, you don't think to yourself, \" his voice was rough and soft at the same time, like a blues singer's mix of gravel and silk \". no, you do not. i also thoroughly enjoyed reading from the perspective of the male love interest in this story. again, so often, stories are all from the girl's perspective, leaving you with no idea as to what is going on in the guy's head. i'm sorry to say, this was one of the drawbacks for me in angelfall by susan ee. in fact, i loved this book so much, that i venture if i'd read it first instead angelfall and gifts of the blood by vicki keire, both of those books would have gotten 4 stars. because that's what laini taylor does. she takes some very common ( and sometimes popular ) story and turns it upside down. black is white and white becomes black. and every time she does it, i am haunted and pea green with envy of her talent. her characters in this book were so well drawn that i think i would know them if i met them on the street. the story was amazing, well laid out, perfectly arranged and just enough to lead me through every feeling : happiness, love, longing, loss, anger, horror... so i guess, even though romeo and juliet isn't my style, laini can break through all my pet peeves and give me hope that i will love all those well worn cliches and story lines again. i wonder what she'd do with vampires.\n",

      "originally posted on slow reader's blog the bird and the sword is amy harmon at her brilliant best. she conjures up a mystical tale filled with meaning, love, and truth, which left me in a state of awe and some disbelief because she turned a stone in me that i was unaware existed, or one i was reluctant to admit existed. amy's talent is fiercely displayed and i don't have much to say other than what's been said before, so to avoid redundancy, i'll write about how this book made me feel and urge you to read it so you may experience the wonder that i did. the bird and the sword is a tale with a message and the message is the power of words. it's about the spells we create with words, the changes we make with words, the people we are because words, the strength we relinquish, and the strength we claim with our words. this book is powerful. it's a quiet power, an unassuming power, but powerful nonetheless. i fell in love with the messages imbedded in this enchanting story. in the bird and the sword, we follow lark, a lonely girl who loses her voice and freedom after the death of her mother. lark can't speak, but she is not silent. as a reader she speaks to you, and you can't help but listen. i so enjoyed getting to know lark and falling under her spell. through harmon's words, which are like a song, lark became real to me, and experiencing her vitality was unlike anything else i'd ever experienced as a reader. she's multidimensional and i felt her loneliness, i felt her curiosity, i felt her bravery, her insecurity, her strength and resolve. i felt every damn thing with her. she's an inspiration. lark's arc and development is the focal point of the bird and the sword, but her story is brilliantly and flawlessly intertwined with the other cast of characters. i keep using that word, but it really can't be overstated how brilliant this novel is. the characters are brilliant! of course lark is the be - all end - all for me, but tiras is a captivating character, and worthy hero. his story is compelling, and his character so romantic and noble that i swooned more than a few times, and i hate that word. but, there's no other way to describe\n",

      "i'll admit this was a challenging book for me at first. the dialogue - - more modern than exotic - - took me out of the story during the first chapter or so, as well as the past / present switches ; and wilson's writing style and sometimes esoteric word choice made it hard to follow what was happening. but i'm really glad i stuck with it as once i settled into the \" world \" of the main character demane, i was hooked, or perhaps more accurately entranced by this gorgeously - told adventure that reads like an epic poem. i'll also admit that i was drawn to the book when i heard that it was in part a love story between two men of color. how rare in the realm of fantasy! in this regard, the sorcerer of wildeeps did not disappoint. the characters are unique, textured, and i think quite likeable and relatable. a previous reviewer mentioned that it was unfortunate that it was another gay tragedy, suggesting that as a weakness in the author's craft ( cliche ). i didn't experience the story that way. we have two options in fiction : tragedy or comedy, so if you write gay fiction, it's going to be one or the other ; and this isn't a story where the sole supporting gay character of color gets killed off. the gay characters of color are front and center, and well - realized, so the inevitability of the tragic ending felt poignant, as it should be, and not contrived. overall, a wonderful accomplishment.\n",

      "sarah glenn marsh's debut novel is filled with mellifluous writing, a gorgeous setting, and a dark mystery that will haunt and captivate readers. the first thing that struck me about this book is the setting. \" fear the drowning deep \" takes place in the early 1900s on a small island close to england. the ocean is such a cryptic and elusive element in this book. it carries both the livelihood of the townspeople yet also the pains and sadness of the treacherous waves that lose people at sea. when young women start disappearing, everyone claims there is a murder in their midst, but main character bridey thinks there is something sinister from sea causing the disappearances. i love the way that sarah portrayed the ocean. it felt like a mercurial yet unforgiving physical person or entity against bridey. i love bridey's confidence in herself. she becomes a bit of a pariah when she claims that a sea monster is responsible for the deaths, not a person. i commend her for still trying to help save the townspeople even after they shun her and spread hateful rumors. i appreciate and deeply admire that she doesn't care what others think of her. the relationships in this book were another hit for me. bridey has three siblings, and i really liked their support for one another. there was no vitriol or bitterness, just love and respect! so often in books siblings are pitted against each other, and i love when i see the exact opposite. the romance in this book is probably my least favorite of the relationships, but i still enjoyed it. there were some cliche moments and cheesy lines fed, but i did like the chemistry that bridey and fynn have. my favorite relationship in this book by far is the one between bridey and the ocean. when bridey was younger, she saw her grandfather drown in the ocean. ever since she's had quite an aversion and hatred towards the ocean. i love how throughout this book we see the ocean challenge her to the very core and make her reexamine the choices she's made in life. there is plenty of mystery and intrigue that made this book an easy read to speed through. this book definitely takes after the cover, it's dark and deep and will definitely surprise you. the ending of this novel was one of my favorites ever! sarah's writing was poetic and charming, and i can't wait to read what she publishes next.\n",

      "ruta sepetys'out of the easy is a bold book about living in the french quarter, new orleans in 1950. i was sucked into this story from page one and read straight through. josie's mother is a prostitute, and that should be enough to make anyone feel sorry for her. but don't. compassion, yes, but ruta gave josie such an amazing group of people to love her and guide her that even with a horrific mother ( being a prostitute isn't what makes her awful ), josie manages to do better than survive, but thrive. your heart will ache and you'll appreciate the good things that come to josie and have your heart break when she's faced with tough times. this is definitely a book to pick up and discover a world most will never get a glimpse into. i've been to new orleans. i've seen the french quarter, so it helped me visualize the streets and added a layer that helped me enjoy this book even more. but having traveled to new orleans is not a prerequisite to appreciating this novel. readers will be mesmerized by the characters and will have a tough time forgetting them after the last page is turned. definitely recommend for older ya. it's a winner!\n",

      "07 / 01 / 13 : simply put, i am obsessed with this series. the dialect, the world, the characters... i love it all. in this final installment, a threat from demalo leaves saba with seven days to either surrender her fight or find a way to defeat him and his plans for new eden. this ticking - clock element keeps the pacing tight and tensions high. a few masterfully crafted scenes written in third person reveal a traitor within saba's group, though the details are vague. i was constantly torn between who i thought the traitor might be and only figured it out pages before the actual reveal. kudos to young for that. the ending is not an easy one, perhaps even closer to heartbreaking than bittersweet, but saba's story is one that will sit with me for years. and i know, without a doubt, that this will be one of the rare series i revisit again and again. originally reviewed here. 11 / 14 / 13 : ugh, and now it's pushed back another month. * cries * seriously, this wait is killing me. i do not have a more highly anticipated book for 2014. 7 / 2 / 13 : and now i share a release date with this book. eeee! i know how i'll be celebrating frozen's launch next april... 6 / 17 / 13 : ahhh it has a name! pardon my intense fangirling!!! 11 / 18 / 12 : i might die from the wait for this book. that's not even an exaggeration. ( okay, maybe a little. )\n",

      "loved this third installment of the heist society series. kat's relationship with hale really develops and is the focus of most of the novel. love hale's relationship with his grandma. totally relatable for anyone who has had a better relationship with a grandparent versus a parent. there's plenty of action that will keep the reader engaged as kat tries to pull off one of the biggest heists in her life. the book ends without any cliffhangers or promises of a fourth installment, but i could definitely see one in the future. and yes, i would absolutely read another one! highly recommend this series for people who are looking for a fun, adventurous, clean read. great for reluctant readers.\n",

      "before i die by jenny downham is a remarkable ya novel about a dying girl named tessa. it's raw, gritty, direct, and descriptive. at first, i found it quite difficult to like tessa. she starts out with a lot of self - destructive behavior, almost like she was trying to push the limits because of her illness, and in turn she left a wake of pain and worry, usually aimed at her father who loves her and has cared for her. enter a remarkable young man named adam who works through his own troubles to be a huge support and the love of tessa's remaining short life. i started out feeling frustrated and by the last page i was in tears. this is one heck of a worthwhile read. it shows how living and dying has to be done on one's own terms. a beautiful novel. i also highly recommend jenny downham's second novel, you against me.\n",

      "an outstanding historical that should especially delight those fans who love reading about the american old west after the civil war. it features a huge, complicated plot that is epic in scope, but which unfolds with tremendous skill and readability from the alternating third - person viewpoints of two of the four main characters. there are also strategic glimpses into the mind of an important supporting character, and the transitions are handled smoothly, scene by scene. the novel hints at a story arc to be covered in sequels to come, but gives a solid and satisfying resolution to the specific plot in this book. the characters are complex and filled with relatable strengths and weaknesses. one of the marshals ( flynn ) and one of the prisoners ( gabriel ) in particular are standout characters - interacting with each other at maximum levels of tension as they clash repeatedly, each trying to get the upper hand. meanwhile, the story offers perfect escapism as the time and place come alive. the author knows much about horses, firearms, frontier law enforcement, and the expressions and mindset of this particular time and place. the richness of detail saturates the story in a natural and all - encompassing way, which never slows the pace or gets in the way of the story. this is a dangerous world on the verge of becoming civilized, but even so, everything remains unpredictable, and very few things in 1882 are done according to hoyle's established rules of the game.\n",

      "an outstanding ya novel about a family who embraces the last months of a father's life before he dies from pancreatic cancer. when taylor edwards was twelve, she ran away from two people she loved - - her best friend lucy and her other best friend and boyfriend henry. running away from problems is her way of dealing with them. but running away hurts people and causes huge fallout. taylor has to learn this lesson. now she's seventeen and back at the lake house where she left lucy and henry. she has to find a way to ask for forgiveness and attempt to rebuild and repair those relationships all while dealing with the impending loss of her beloved father. what i loved : the emotions and relationships were very authentic. it's not maudlin, but deeply touching and will make you cry. relationships are messy. taylor repeats some mistakes, but the people around her support her in learning to see how the one she's hurting the most is herself and that running away from problems only make bigger ones. pushing people away doesn't make you immune to pain, it can actually do the opposite. the sweet romance between henry and lucy. the setting is beautiful and i could picture the lake, the houses, the forest, the town. beautifully done. taylor's little sister gelsey and her brother warren. two of the best scenes were when taylor and lucy help gelsey and her best friend have an amazing sleepover. the other is when taylor asks a girl out for warren! priceless! focuses on living versus dying, but doesn't hide the process of dying either. it's written authentically and believably. this novel was on several \" top reads lists \" by some of my blogger friends, but especially rachel kinnard's of http : / / tigerlilyrachel. com. rachel definitely was the driving force behind me picking up this novel. thank you so much rachel. i totally understand and agree : second chance summer belongs on my top reads list for 2014!\n",

      "so, i'm going to start off this review by confessing something : i fell out of love with reading and reviewing in the spring. without getting into the nitty gritty of it, there was an incident involving an author that made me question everything i had ever felt, learned or experienced as a reviewer. i couldn't read a book without struggling, and being reminded of that incident. eventually, i put all of my books down and just walked away. but as the weather has gotten cooler and the nights longer, i've found myself wanting to read again. and so it was with a certain sense of kinship and understanding, that i began reading a season for fireflies by rebecca maizel. it's because in many ways, penny berne is like me. she begins the book loving theater, but an unpleasant incident jars her enough that she quits acting for different friends and a different life. it's not until an accident involving a lightning strike and amnesia, which leads penny to reevaluate the choices she's made. while i've always liked rebecca maizel's writing, i was actually a little blown away by just how acutely she seemed to understand the emotional ups - and - downs that come with dealing with physical and emotional trauma. because though penny doesn't get struck with lightning until a few chapters into the book, she's been dealing with emotional trauma far longer. we see her reluctance to handle that trauma in her decision to run away from her life in theater, and how it's the lightning strike and subsequent amnesia that gives the unwitting opportunity to face that previous trauma, head on. though penny is obviously relieved when her attempts to rejoin her previous life seem to take hold, maizel is also careful to emphasize that the life and friends penny established in the interim, absolutely had its own merits. maizel emphasizes kylie's loyalty and strength, and readers end up absolutely understanding just why penny sought her friendship out, despite seemingly having nothing in common. the kylie / penny friendship actually really emphasizes the idea that there are times when one's friendships will evolve as one evolves as a person, and maizel makes it a point to really highlight just the pieces that both penny's old friends and new ( er ) friends bring to her life. it's an interesting study on social relationships, and how we each grow, as we age. set against a backdrop where mysterious fireflies have invaded the town - which honestly reminded me of this scene\n",

      "this reading year was somewhat odd for me. looking back, i recognize that part of 2014 and all of 2015 was kind of an emotional rebuilding time for me personally. i was a little bit in retreat and had gotten too comfortable with it. this year i finally started stirring things up again and began to feel more like myself. but i was still devoted to getting a lot of reading done, and i think in the process of trying to integrate everything, my usual reading habits fell apart. i did have a goal in 2016 of reading more writers of color, lgbtq writers, and male writers - - in other words, writers less like myself - - and i'm happy to say i accomplished that goal. beyond that, things were all over the place. i probably read fewer novels than any other year, and i kept reading nonfiction books back - to - back, which is very unusual for me. usually i can read several novels in a row, but after a nonfiction book i feel the need to go back to fiction immediately afterward. not the case this year. even stranger, i went through a reading slump where i got bored with everything after 60 pages. i'd never had a reading slump before, and boy did it suck. even worse was the first few weeks after the horrifying election result, when it was next to impossible to find a book that felt like the right thing to be reading. in spite of all this, i read 111 books in 2016, a personal best, and looking back, there were a lot of awesome books in there, ones that are still vivid in my memory even if i read them months ago. here are the best. best book the argonauts by maggie nelson. i recognize this book isn't for everyone, but i was captivated by it and felt like it awakened parts of me that had been dormant for too long. i'm now a devoted fan of maggie nelson and look forward to keeping up with her work in the coming decades. honorable mentions fiction telegraph avenue by michael chabon the namesake by jhumpa lahiri 10 : 04 by ben lerner you are not a stranger here by adam haslett shelter by jung yun a tale for the time being by ruth ozeki giovanni's room by james baldwin nonfiction the dead ladies project by jessa crispin spinster by kate bolick night by elie wiesel on immunity by eula biss boy erased by garrard conley party of one by dave holmes between the world and me by ta\n",

      "spoilers. i've never felt so internally polarized by a book. it's some of the loveliest writing i've read in recent history ; the circus itself is described in achingly beautiful detail and i've rarely wanted so much to go to a fictional place. the magic in the book is gorgeously rendered and gave me that nice, engaged but sort of floaty feeling that magic done well can give you. as the last line of the book says, \" you are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is the dream. \" that's the way it feels, reading passages about the circus, either in thiessen's passages or in the second - person sections, or often reading about the main characters ( bailey especially ) exploring the circus. i also loved many of the people involved in the circus - - isobel is so open - hearted and lovely, the murray twins so fun and passionate, tsukiko such a badass. so the titular part of the novel was wonderfully executed. it's the blurb part that i had real trouble with ; \" luxuriously romantic, \" \" tumbling headfirst into love, \" etc. i started the book with high hopes for a gorgeous romance, but began to hope pretty early on that it wouldn't be between celia and marco - - not because it was expected or cliche or a trope or whatever, bring on the tropes, but because marco was such an unpleasant person. that's something other people think too, right? marco is obviously a huge jerk. if it was part of the author's intent to show marco as a damaged, lonely person and a product of a bad upbringing and for that to help explain ( not excuse ) his unpleasantness, it didn't come across in the text enough for me. his constant meddling with chandresh's mind, his dismissal of the desires and feelings and lives of everyone except celia, the direct parallels between his treatment of isobel and celia's father's treatment of her mother - - that in particular was surely meant as a flashing warning sign, right? he turned every conversation into a reflection on himself or celia's beauty or his relationship with celia's beauty ; especially egregious was when celia was mourning the death of thiessen, a dear friend she loved, and marco's response was basically \" oh he wrote you, i would have written you too except you're too great to write about\n",
